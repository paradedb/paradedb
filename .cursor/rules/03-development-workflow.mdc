# Development Workflow

## Getting Started

- ParadeDB extension (`pg_search`) is developed using `pgrx`, a framework for Postgres extension development in Rust
- Install development tools according to the instructions in the `pg_search/README.md` file

## Development Process

1. Implement your changes with appropriate tests
2. Run all added/modified tests to verify they pass

## Testing

- Don't use `cargo test` directly
- Use the `scripts/pg_search_test.sh` script for running tests:
  - Example: `PGVER=17.4 ../scripts/pg_search_test.sh --test sorting`
  - This runs the specified test (in this example, the "sorting" test)
  - Possible PGVER values:
    - 14.17
    - 15.12
    - 16.8
    - 17.4
  - If PGVER is not specified, it defaults to 17.4

## SQL Queries

- Use the `scripts/pg_search_run.sh` script for running SQL queries:
  - Example: `PGVER=17.4 ./scripts/pg_search_run.sh -c "SELECT 1"`
  - This script sets up the proper environment and database connection

## Debugging

- For logging and debugging, use `pgrx::warning!` macro:
  - These warnings will appear in the output of `scripts/pg_search_run.sh`
  - Example: `pgrx::warning!("Debug value: {:?}", my_value);`
  - Useful for tracking execution flow and inspecting variables

## Performance

- Be mindful of performance implications for database operations
- Consider adding benchmarks for performance-critical code
- Document any performance considerations or trade-offs
