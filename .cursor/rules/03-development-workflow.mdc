# Development Workflow

## Getting Started

- ParadeDB extensions are developed using `pgrx`, a framework for Postgres extension development in Rust
- Install development tools according to the instructions in the `pg_search/README.md` file

## Development Process

1. Before making changes, run the test suite to ensure your environment is set up correctly
2. Implement your changes with appropriate tests
3. Run all tests to verify they pass
4. Run benchmarks if your change might affect performance

## Testing

- Don't use `cargo test` directly
- Use the `scripts/pg_search_test.sh` script for running tests:
  - Example: `PGVER=17.4 ../scripts/pg_search_test.sh --test sorting`
  - This runs the specified test (in this example, the "sorting" test)
  - Possible PGVER values:
    - 14.17
    - 15.12
    - 16.8
    - 17.4
  - If PGVER is not specified, it defaults to 17.4

## SQL Queries

- Use the `scripts/pg_search_run.sh` script for running SQL queries:
  - Example: `PGVER=17.4 ../scripts/pg_search_run.sh psql -c "SELECT 1"`
  - This script sets up the proper environment and database connection

## Debugging

- For logging and debugging, use `pgrx::warning!` macro:
  - These warnings will appear in the output of `scripts/pg_search_run.sh`
  - Example: `pgrx::warning!("Debug value: {:?}", my_value);`
  - Useful for tracking execution flow and inspecting variables

## Performance

- Be mindful of performance implications for database operations
- Consider adding benchmarks for performance-critical code
- Document any performance considerations or trade-offs
