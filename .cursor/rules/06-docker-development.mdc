# Docker Development Guidelines

## Docker Image Structure

- ParadeDB is distributed as a Docker image based on PostgreSQL
- All images should be properly tagged with version information
- Use multi-stage builds where appropriate to minimize image size
- Follow Docker best practices for security and efficiency

## Docker Best Practices

- Keep images as small as possible
- Use specific versions for base images instead of `latest`
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Include appropriate health checks
- Properly document environment variables and volumes

## Docker Compose

- When using Docker Compose for development, ensure consistent environment across all developers
- Document all services and their purposes
- Include appropriate networking configuration
- Use volumes for persistent data

## Docker Build Process

- Follow the existing build pipeline
- Ensure images are properly scanned for vulnerabilities
- Test images thoroughly before release
- Document any changes to the Docker build process

## CI/CD for Docker

- Automated builds should be set up for different tags and branches
- Test Docker images in CI to ensure they work as expected
- Document the release process for Docker images
