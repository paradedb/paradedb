[ParadeDB](https://paradedb.com) is an Elasticsearch alternative built on Postgres. We're modernizing the features of Elasticsearch's product suite, starting with real-time search and analytics.

## Status

ParadeDB is currently in Public Beta. Star and watch this repository to get notified of updates.

### Roadmap

- [x] Search
  - [x] Full-text search with BM25 with [pg_search](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_search#overview)
  - [x] Dense and sparse vector search with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#pgvector) & [pgvectorscale](https://github.com/timescale/pgvectorscale#pgvectorscale)
  - [x] Hybrid search
- [ ] Analytics
  - [x] An analytical query engine over any object store or table format with [pg_lakehouse](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_lakehouse#overview)
  - [ ] Column-oriented table access method for fast analytics inside Postgres
- [x] Self-Hosted ParadeDB
  - [x] Docker image based on [postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) & [deployment instructions](https://docs.paradedb.com/deploy/aws)
  - [x] Kubernetes Helm chart based on [CloudNativePG](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg) & [deployment instructions](https://docs.paradedb.com/deploy/helm)
- [x] Specialized Workloads
  - [ ] Support for geospatial data with [PostGIS](https://github.com/postgis/postgis)
  - [x] Support for cron jobs with [pg_cron](https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron)
  - [x] Support for basic incremental view maintenance (IVM) via [pg_ivm](https://github.com/sraoss/pg_ivm)

## Get Started

To get started, please visit our [documentation](https://docs.paradedb.com).

## Deploying ParadeDB

ParadeDB and its extensions are available as commercial software for installation on self-hosted Postgres deployment and via Docker and Kubernetes as standalone images. For more information, including enterprise features and support, please [contact us by email](mailto:sales@paradedb.com).

### Extensions

You can find prebuilt binaries for all ParadeDB extensions on Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 for Postgres 14, 15 and 16 in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/latest). We officially support Postgres 12 and above, and you can compile the extensions for other versions of Postgres by following the instructions in the respective extension's README.

### Docker Image

To quickly get a ParadeDB instance up and running, simply pull and run the latest Docker image:

```bash
docker run --name paradedb -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password paradedb/paradedb
```

This will start a ParadeDB instance with default user `postgres` and password `password`. You can then connect to the database using `psql`:

```bash
docker exec -it paradedb psql -U postgres
```

To install ParadeDB locally or on-premise, we recommend using our `docker-compose.yml` file. Alternatively, you can pass the appropriate environment variables to the `docker run` command, replacing the <> with your desired values:

```bash
docker run \
  --name paradedb \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=<user> \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=<dbname> \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -v paradedb_data:/var/lib/postgresql/ \
  -d \
  paradedb/paradedb:latest
```

This will start a ParadeDB instance with non-root user `<user>` and password `<password>`. The `-v` flag enables your ParadeDB data to persist across restarts in a Docker volume named `paradedb_data`.

You can then connect to the database using `psql`:

```bash
docker exec -it paradedb psql -U <user> -d <dbname> -p 5432 -W
```

ParadeDB collects anonymous telemetry to help us understand how many people are using the project. You can opt out of telemetry using configuration variables within Postgres:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET paradedb.pg_search_telemetry TO 'off';
ALTER SYSTEM SET paradedb.pg_lakehouse_telemetry TO 'off';
```

### Helm Chart

ParadeDB is also available for Kubernetes via our Helm chart. You can find our Helm chart in the [ParadeDB Helm Chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/paradedb/helm-charts) or download it directly from [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/paradedb/paradedb).

### ParadeDB Cloud
