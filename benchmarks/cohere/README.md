# Cohere vector CI

Cohere keeps the native pgrx cluster, pgBackRest heap snapshots, and index build
used by the existing CI. `paradedb/pdbench` selects recall operating points;
`paradedb/benchmarker` measures search latency and throughput.

The workflow runs the 1M and 10M snapshots independently. Each uses the existing
100 held-out vectors, exact ground-truth fixtures, and unfiltered, approximately
10% (`year`), and approximately 1% (`battle`) full-text filters. The index retains
eight segments, a 0.32 training sample ratio, and English stemming/stopwords on
`text`. The shared cluster setup retains 12 GiB shared buffers and eight parallel
workers. Both tools use the same database and index throughout a run.

1. Restore the existing Cohere heap snapshot, refresh the installed pg_search
   extension, and run `pdbench build` with `datasets/cohere/indexes/pg_search.sql`.
   pdbench records build time, index size, and segment diagnostics before vacuum.
   Snapshot generation continues to use `datasets/cohere/config.toml` and
   `create_tables.sql`.
2. Import the published ground-truth Parquets into pdbench's fixture table.
   `admission_experiment.py` first sweeps `paradedb.vector_cluster_max_probe` with
   adaptive stopping disabled to establish matched routing plans. It measures
   each exponent in `{0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6}` at the requested recall
   targets 0.90, 0.95 and 0.99, across all three filters. Every measurement uses
   all 100 vectors, three timed repetitions and a separate EXPLAIN pass.
3. Select one exponent across all nine operating points, minimizing the worst
   recall shortfall, then total shortfall, then exponent. No per-filter
   calibration is allowed. Repeat the matrix with that exponent and a shared
   probe ceiling of 0.125. Matched-budget results isolate stopping quality;
   shared-budget results test dependence on routing and filter bypass.
   Export both matrices with their measured recall. Unreached targets remain
   visible and do not run in k6. The complete calibration grid is retained.
4. k6 cycles over the same 100 vectors with one VU: 10 seconds of discarded
   warmup and 50 seconds of measurement per filter/target. The vector is bound
   as a parameter, with custom plans and no prepared-statement cache. The
   shared recall exponent, requested recall target, and fixed search settings
   apply to every connection.
   CI verifies the parameterized plans and filter pushdown before measuring.
5. Results and recall context enter the shared publication queue. The
   Wikipedia/StackExchange publisher posts p50/p95/p99, QPS, index build time,
   and index size with baseline comparisons and dashboard links. Recall,
   recall exponent, fixed probe budget, and mean whole-query shared buffer hits/reads appear above those
   results. Buffer diagnostics come from pdbench's separate EXPLAIN pass over all
   100 vectors.

The workflow runs on main and via `benchmarks`, `benchmark-cohere-pg_search`, or
`benchmark-benchmarker-cohere`. Manual runs can select a size, pg_search commit,
and tool refs. Competitor vector CI implementations and labels are retired.
The pdbench checkout uses the ParadeDB GitHub App's read access to the private
repository. Both tool revisions are pinned and recorded in diagnostics. The
fixture import only populates pdbench's ground-truth table; the corpus is restored
from its snapshot.

Results begin new `benchmarker cohere-1m` and `benchmarker cohere-10m` histories.
The old server-time samples are not comparable to k6's client-observed latency
and throughput. Index build time (minutes) and size (MiB) have a separate
`benchmarker cohere-<size> (index build)` history. Its first run has no previous
baseline; subsequent PR runs compare with main and do not update its baseline.

Artifacts retain index-build logs, pdbench build and search reports (including
all sweep points, recall and buffer diagnostics), selected operating points,
query vectors, checked plans, and k6 JSON/HTML dashboards. The full workload is opt-in
on PRs; the small handoff tests can be run with:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s benchmarks/cohere -p 'test_*.py'
```
