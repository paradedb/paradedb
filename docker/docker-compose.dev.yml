#
# This docker-compose.dev.yml file is for development deployments of ParadeDB only. It directly builds our
# Dockerfile, which has all ParadeDB extensions pre-installed and properly configured. It is not intended for
# production use. For production usage, please use docker-compose.yml.
#
# There are several other environment variables which can be specified here to configure replication, TLS,
# and a few other settings. They can be found here:
