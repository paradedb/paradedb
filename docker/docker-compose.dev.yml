# This docker-compose.dev.yml file is for development deployments of ParadeDB only. It directly builds our
# Dockerfile, which packages all ParadeDB extensions. It is not intended for production use. For hobby production
# usage, please use docker-compose.yml. For professional production usage, we recommend using our Helm chart.
