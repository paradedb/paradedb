                        the PostgreSQL server. If set to true, an immediate checkpoint will be
                        used, meaning PostgreSQL will complete the checkpoint as soon as

                        without waiting for WAL to be archived.
                        This behavior is only useful with backup software that independently monitors WAL archiving.
                        Otherwise, WAL required to make the backup consistent might be missing and make the backup useless.
                        By default, or when this parameter is true, pg_backup_stop will wait for WAL to be archived when archiving is
                        enabled.
                        On a standby, this means that it will wait only when archive_mode = always.
                        If write activity on the primary is low, it may be useful to run pg_switch_wal on the primary in order to trigger
                        an immediate segment switch.

                                specific requirements or configurations.

                                Example:
                                In a scenario where specialized backup options are required, such as setting
                                a specific timeout or defining custom behavior, users can use this field

                                Otherwise, WAL required to make the backup consistent might be missing and make the backup useless.

                                On a standby, this means that it will wait only when archive_mode = always.
                                If write activity on the primary is low, it may be useful to run pg_switch_wal on the primary in order to trigger

                        The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                        owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                        pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                        `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                        entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                        is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                        An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                        will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated

                        the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                        meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                        owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally

                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                  in any namespaces.
                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                          IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to this
                                          service. This field is usually assigned automatically based on cluster

                                          for adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not allow
                                          changing the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are "IPv4"

                                          publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints for this
                                          Service should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready.
                                          The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to
                                          propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery.
                                          The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                                          Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                                          Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                                          through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                                          type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                                          options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                                          "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                          to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                                          specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                                          EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                          allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                          than a virtual IP.
                                          "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                          routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                          "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                          (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                          as the clusterIP.
                                          "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                                          Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                              may change the order over time.

                              Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate
                              chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.

                              Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a
                              PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the
                              request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
                              certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
                              certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume
                              source in its spec.

                              Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
                              by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
                              timestamp.

                              Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
                              field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and
                              certificateChainPath fields.

                              The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
                              entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
                              entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
                              signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).

                              Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code
                              can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,
                              your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
                              with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
                              certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
                              will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
                              consistent.

                              The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it
                              issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to
                              use the certificates it issues.

                                  Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath
                                  and certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key
                                  and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the
                                  files mid-rotation.

                                  Write the credential bundle at this path in the projected volume.

                                  The credential bundle is a single file that contains multiple PEM blocks.
                                  The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private
                                  key.

                                  The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks, containing the issued
                                  certificate chain from the signer (leaf and any intermediates).

                                  Using credentialBundlePath lets your Pod's application code make a single
                                  atomic read that retrieves a consistent key and certificate chain.  If you
                                  project them to separate files, your application code will need to
                                  additionally check that the leaf certificate was issued to the key.

                                  Kubelet copies this value verbatim into the PodCertificateRequests it
                                  generates for this projection.

                                  If omitted, kube-apiserver will set it to 86400(24 hours). kube-apiserver
                                  will reject values shorter than 3600 (1 hour).  The maximum allowable
                                  value is 7862400 (91 days).

                                  The signer implementation is then free to issue a certificate with any
                                  lifetime *shorter* than MaxExpirationSeconds, but no shorter than 3600
                                  seconds (1 hour).  This constraint is enforced by kube-apiserver.
                                  `kubernetes.io` signers will never issue certificates with a lifetime
                                  longer than 24 hours.

                            core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                            When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                            the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic

                            This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                            if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                            compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                            both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                            value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.

                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                              specified.
                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                              in any namespaces.
                            (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                            (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                    specified.
                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                    in any namespaces.
                                  (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                          to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                          for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.

                          MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                          When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                          between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                          The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                          or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                          In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                          |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                          - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                          scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                          violate MaxSkew(1).
                          - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                          When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                          to topologies that satisfy it.

                          MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                          When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                          Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                          And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                          this value has no effect on scheduling.
                          As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                          scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                          If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                          Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                          When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                          |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                          The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                          In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                          because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                          it will violate MaxSkew.

                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is

                            of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                            traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                            the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                            be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                            routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                            features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                            within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                            a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                            The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to
                            propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery.

                            Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                            through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                            "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                            to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                            specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                            EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                            allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                            than a virtual IP.
                            "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                            routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                            "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                            (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                            as the clusterIP.
                            "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                            Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                                      PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                      API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                      preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                      container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                      PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                      container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                      period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                      or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                  RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                  This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                  the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                  Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                  have the following effect:
                                  this init container will be continually restarted on
                                  exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                  containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                  will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                  is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                  container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                  for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                  container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                  init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                  completed.

                                        RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                        recursively.

                                        If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                        If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                        recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                        recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                        field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                        supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                        an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                        If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                        None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                        If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                              user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or
                              scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is
                              removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the

                              Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be removed or restarted.

                                        to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e.

                                      PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                      API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                      preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                      container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                      PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                      container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                      period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                      or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                      Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully upon probe failure.
                                      The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                      a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                                      Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                      If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                      value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                      Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                      the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                                      This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.
                                      Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.

                            If set to true or not present, the pod will be run in the host user namespace, useful
                            for when the pod needs a feature only available to the host user namespace, such as
                            loading a kernel module with CAP_SYS_MODULE.
                            When set to false, a new userns is created for the pod. Setting false is useful for
                            mitigating container breakout vulnerabilities even allowing users to run their
                            containers as root without actually having root privileges on the host.

                            Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                            init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                            to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                            unique among all containers.
                            Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                            The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                            by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                            that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                            in a similar fashion.
                            Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                  RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                  This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                  the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                  Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                  have the following effect:
                                  this init container will be continually restarted on
                                  exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                  containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                  will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                  is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                  container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                  for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                  container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                  init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                  completed.

                                  the Container-level restart policy determines the whether the container
                                  is restarted or not. Constraints on the rules:

                              description: |-
                                seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                  MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                  between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                  The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                  or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                  In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                  |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                  - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                  scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                  violate MaxSkew(1).
                                  - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                  to topologies that satisfy it.
                                  It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                  MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                  When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                  Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                  And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                  this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                  As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                  scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                  If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                  Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                  When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                  |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                  The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                  In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                  because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                  it will violate MaxSkew.

                                  We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                  of pods into each bucket.
                                  We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.

                                    but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                    skew.
                                  A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                                  "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                                  MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler

                                description: |-
                                  ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                  The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                  and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                  Use this if:
                                  a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                  b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                     tracking are needed,
                                  c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                  d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                     a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                     information on the connection between this volume type
                                     and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                  Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                  APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                  of an individual pod.

                                  Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                  be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                  more information.

                                  A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                  persistent volumes at the same time.
                                properties:

                                      Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                      The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                      owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                      pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                      `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                      entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                      is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                      An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                      will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                      volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                      the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                      meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                      owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                      this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                      manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                              volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non

                                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such

                                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef

                                  image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                  The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                  - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                  - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                  - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                  The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                  A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                  The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                  The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                  The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                  Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                  The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                      Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                      Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                      IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                      Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                      Behaves in the same way as pod.spec.containers[*].image.
                                      Pull secrets will be assembled in the same way as for the container image by looking up node credentials, SA image pull secrets, and pod spec image pull secrets.

                                            Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate
                                            chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.

                                            Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a
                                            PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the
                                            request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
                                            certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
                                            certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume
                                            source in its spec.

                                            Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
                                            by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
                                            timestamp.

                                            Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
                                            field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and
                                            certificateChainPath fields.

                                            The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
                                            entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
                                            entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
                                            signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).

                                            Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code
                                            can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,
                                            your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
                                            with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
                                            certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
                                            will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
                                            consistent.

                                            The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it
                                            issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to
                                            use the certificates it issues.

                                                Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath
                                                and certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key
                                                and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the
                                                files mid-rotation.

                                                Write the credential bundle at this path in the projected volume.

                                                The credential bundle is a single file that contains multiple PEM blocks.
                                                The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private
                                                key.

                                                The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks, containing the issued
                                                certificate chain from the signer (leaf and any intermediates).

                                                Using credentialBundlePath lets your Pod's application code make a single
                                                atomic read that retrieves a consistent key and certificate chain.  If you
                                                project them to separate files, your application code will need to
                                                additionally check that the leaf certificate was issued to the key.

                                                maxExpirationSeconds is the maximum lifetime permitted for the
                                                certificate.

                                                Kubelet copies this value verbatim into the PodCertificateRequests it
                                                generates for this projection.

                                                will reject values shorter than 3600 (1 hour).  The maximum allowable
                                                value is 7862400 (91 days).

                                                The signer implementation is then free to issue a certificate with any
                                                lifetime *shorter* than MaxExpirationSeconds, but no shorter than 3600
                                                seconds (1 hour).  This constraint is enforced by kube-apiserver.
                                                `kubernetes.io` signers will never issue certificates with a lifetime

                        This behavior is only useful with backup software that independently monitors WAL archiving.
                        Otherwise, WAL required to make the backup consistent might be missing and make the backup useless.
                        By default, or when this parameter is true, pg_backup_stop will wait for WAL to be archived when archiving is
                        enabled.
                        On a standby, this means that it will wait only when archive_mode = always.
                        If write activity on the primary is low, it may be useful to run pg_switch_wal on the primary in order to trigger
