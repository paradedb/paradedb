## Basic Usage

A boost query wraps around another query to amplify its scoring impact, without altering the set of matched documents.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
	query => paradedb.boost(query => paradedb.all(), boost => 1.5)
);
```

<ParamField body="boost" required>
  The factor by which to multiply the score of each result.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query" required>The query to perform.</ParamField>
