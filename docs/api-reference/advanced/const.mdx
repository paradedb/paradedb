title: Const Score
---

## Basic Usage

Applies a constant score across all documents matched by the underlying query. It can avoid unnecessary score computation on the wrapped query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
    query => paradedb.const_score(query => paradedb.all(), score => 3.9)
);
```

<ParamField body="score" required>The constant score to use for each result.</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query" required>The query to perform.</ParamField>
