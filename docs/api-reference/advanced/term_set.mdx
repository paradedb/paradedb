<Note>
  BM25 scoring is not enabled for TermSet queries. As a result,
  the scores returned may not be accurate. This behavior reflects the underlying
  implementation in Tantivy.

## Basic Usage

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
	query => paradedb.term_set(
	    terms => ARRAY[
	        paradedb.term(field => 'description', value => 'shoes'),
	        paradedb.term(field => 'description', value => 'novel')
	    ]
	)
);
```

<ParamField body="terms" required>
  An `ARRAY` of `paradedb.term` query objects.
