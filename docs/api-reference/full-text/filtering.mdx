title: Filtering
---

The ParadeQL query accepts filters, which can drastically improve query times compared to standard SQL `WHERE` clauses.
For optimal performance and ranking, it is important to pass filters directly into the search query whenever possible.

## Numeric Filter

The following query returns all rows matching `description:keyboard` where `rating` equals `4`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:keyboard AND rating:4');
```

Comparison operators `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=` are supported.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:keyboard AND rating:>=4');
```

## Datetime Filter

RFC3339-formatted dates can be used to filter over datetime fields.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('created_at:"2023-04-15T13:27:09Z"');
```

## Boolean Filter

Boolean fields can be filtered with `true` or `false`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('in_stock:true');
```

## Range Filter

The inclusive `[]` and exclusive `{}` bounds can be used for range filtering.

```sql
-- Numeric
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('rating:[1 TO 4]');

-- Datetime
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
    'created_at:[2020-01-31T00:00:00Z TO 2024-01-31T00:00:00Z]'
);
```

Range filters can also be applied over text fields. The following query finds all documents where 
`description` contains a token that is lexicographically between `book` and `camera` (i.e. would come between
`book` and `camera` in a dictionary).

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:[book TO camera]');
```

## Set Filter

The `IN` operator finds documents that match at least one element in a set.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('rating:IN [2 3 4]');
```
