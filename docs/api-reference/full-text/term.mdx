title: Term Search
---

## Basic Usage

Terms must be prefixed by the field name.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:keyboard');
```

At search time, the term `keyboard` is automatically tokenized in the same way that the `description` field is tokenized.

## Multiple Terms

Multiple terms can be wrapped inside parentheses.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:(shoes keyboard)');
```

This query matches all documents that contain `shoes`, `keyboard`, or both.

## Negative Term

By prepending a term with `-`, a term can be excluded from the search.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:(shoes -running)');
```

## Must Term

By prepending a term with `+`, a term can be made required for search.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:(shoes +running)');
```

## Boolean Operators

`AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` can be used to combine and filter multiple terms.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:keyboard OR category:toy');
```

Use parentheses to group terms and control the order of operations.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
  '(description:keyboard OR category:toy) AND description:metal'
);
```

## Special Characters

The special characters `+` , `^`, ```, `:`, `{`, `}`, `"`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `~`, `!`, `\\`, `\*`, and `SPACE` must be escaped by a`\` inside the query term.
