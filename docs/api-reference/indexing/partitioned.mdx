## Partitioned Index

In Postgres, a partitioned index is an index created over a [partitioned table](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html).
A BM25 index can be created over a partitioned table in the same way as a normal table.

## Partial Index

The following code block demonstrates how to pass predicates to `create_bm25`
to construct a [partial index](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-partial.html). Partial
indexes are useful for reducing index size on disk and improving update speeds over non-indexed rows.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25(
  index_name => 'search_idx',
  table_name => 'mock_items',
  key_field => 'id',
  text_fields => paradedb.field('description'),
  predicates => 'category = ''Electronics'' AND rating > 2'
);
```
