We're unveiling `pg_bm25`: a Rust-based Postgres extension that significantly improves Postgres' full text
search capabilities. `pg_bm25` is named after BM25, the algorithm used by modern search engines to calculate the
relevance scores of search results.

Today, Postgres' native full text search, which uses the `tsvector` type, has two main problems:

1. **Performance**: Searching and ranking over large tables is sluggish. When tables grow to millions of rows, a single full text search can take several minutes.
2. **Functionality**: Postgres has no support for operations like fuzzy search, relevance tuning, or
   BM25 relevance scoring, which are the bread and butter of modern search engines.

`pg_bm25` aims to bridge the gap between the native capabilities of Postgres’ full text search and those of a specialized search engine like ElasticSearch.
The goal is to eliminate the need to bring a cumbersome service like ElasticSearch into the data stack.

Some features of `pg_bm25` include:

- 100% Postgres native, with zero dependencies on an external search engine
- Built on top of Tantivy, a Rust-based alternative to the Apache Lucene search library
- Query times over 1M rows are 20x faster compared to `tsquery` and `ts_rank`, Postgres' built-in full text search and sort functions
- Support for fuzzy search, aggregations, highlighting, and relevance tuning
- Relevance scoring uses BM25, the same algorithm used by ElasticSearch
- Real-time search — new data is immediately searchable without manual reindexing

`pg_bm25` stands on the shoulders of several open-source giants. The goal of this blog post is to recognize these projects
and to share how `pg_bm25` was built.

## The Shoulders of Giants

Putting a search engine inside of Postgres is hard. A few projects have attempted it, but with one caveat: every
single one has relied on an external ElasticSearch instance. This means introducing a
complex and expensive piece of infrastructure into the data stack. Perhaps the best-known example of this kind of design
is a Postgres extension called [ZomboDB](https://github.com/zombodb/zombodb).

In 2016, an open source search library called [Tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy) emerged. Tantivy
was designed as a Rust-based alternative to Apache Lucene, the search library that powers ElasticSearch.
Three years later, a library called [pgrx](https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx) — built by the same
author of ZomboDB — made it possible to build Postgres extensions in Rust.
Combined, these projects laid the groundwork for a Postgres extension that could create Elastic-quality
search experiences within Postgres.

## Creating the Inverted Index

Like ElasticSearch, the backbone of Tantivy's search engine is a data structure called the inverted index,
which stores a mapping from words to their locations in a set of documents. An inverted index
is like the table of contents of a book — without it, you might have to examine every page to find
a specific chapter.

Rather than creating this inverted index externally, `pg_bm25` stores the
index inside Postgres as a new, Postgres-native index type, which we call the BM25 index. This is made possible
through Postgres' [index access method](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexam.html) API.

When a BM25 index is created, Postgres automatically updates it as new data arrives
or is deleted in the underlying SQL table. In this way, `pg_bm25` enables real-time search without any
additional reindexing logic.

## Building the SQL Interface

Following index creation, the next step was to expose an intuitive SQL interface for users to write search queries.
This was accomplished through the Postgres [operator API](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createoperator.html),
which enables the creation of custom Postgres operators. We chose the `@@@` operator to signify the beginning
of a query to the BM25 index in homage to the `@@` operator used by Postgres' native full text search.

The end result is the ability to search any table with a single SQL query.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_table
WHERE my_table @@@ '"my query string"'
```

Wherever possible, we designed the SQL interface to transparently mirror Tantivy's API. For instance,
the right-hand side of the `@@@` operator accepts Tantivy's mini query language and configuration options.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_table
WHERE my_table @@@ 'description:keyboard^2 OR electronics:::fuzzy_fields=description&distance=2'
```

## Performance Benchmarks

On a table with one million rows, `pg_bm25` indexes 50 seconds faster than `tsvector` and ranks results
20x faster. Indexing and search times are nearly identical to those of a dedicated ElasticSearch instance.
With further optimizations, we're aiming to reduce the query times compared to ElasticSearch
by an additional 2x.

More detailed benchmark results can be found in the [README](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/blob/dev/benchmarks/README.md).

## Wrapping Up

`pg_bm25` is ready for use today. There are two ways to try it: [installing it](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_bm25#installation) inside an existing, self-hosted Postgres instance,
or [running the Postgres Docker image](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb#from-self-hosted-postgres).

`pg_bm25` is open-source and licensed under AGPL. If you'd like to contribute, the best place to start is our
