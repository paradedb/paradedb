## Performance Improvements 🚀

Introduced support for index-only scans for queries that project **only** over the `key_field`. In practice, this means that
simple `COUNT` facets will be much faster.

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ 'description:shoes';
```

## Documentation 📚

We've overhauled the deployment section of the documentation with more thorough, up-to-date guides.

## Housekeeping 🏡

Introduced support for Postgres 17.
