## New Features 🚀

- [#1919](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/pull/1919) added support for Regex Phrase queries. The documentation can be found [here](/documentation/advanced/phrase/regex_phrase).
- [ParadeDB Enterprise] an optional MVCC flag was added to accelerated aggregates to enable faster performance on queries which don't require MVCC correctness.

## Stability Improvements 💪

- [#1996](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/pull/1996) fixed a bug where tokenizing emoji and multi-byte characters with the ICU tokenizer would cause index out-of-bounds errors or deadlocks.
- [ParadeDB Enterprise] fixed a bug where queries combining JOINs and fast fields would cause a crash.
