## Introducing Block Storage

`pg_search` is now on Postgres block storage ðŸŽ‰

To ParadeDB Community, this brings:

- ~5X improvement to indexing times
- ~20X improvement to write throughput
- Integration with Postgres' buffer cache

To ParadeDB Enterprise it brings:

- Postgres write-ahead log (WAL) integration
- Physical replication support
- Crash and point-in-time recovery
- CloudNativePG compatibility for high availability

Because this is a breaking change, upgrade scripts to `0.14.0` are not provided. To upgrade:

1. Drop all existing `pg_search` indexes
2. Drop the `pg_search` extension
3. Stop Postgres
4. Pull the latest Docker image or download and install the latest `pg_search` extension binary
5. Start Postgres
6. Create the `pg_search` extension
7. Rebuild all indexes
