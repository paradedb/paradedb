title: 0.15.0

<Note>
  `0.15.0` contains breaking changes. After upgrading, all BM25 indexes must be
  recreated with `REINDEX`.
</Note>

## New Features ðŸŽ‰

### Match Query

Introducing a new query builder function: [`paradedb.match`](/documentation/advanced/full-text/match). Similar to Elasticsearch's match query,
`paradedb.match` is meant to be the standard query function for full text search, allowing for
custom tokenizers and fuzzy matching. It supersedes the `paradedb.fuzzy_phrase` query.

### JSON Term Set

`paradedb.term_set` now supports JSON fields.

## Performance Improvements ðŸš€

- Modified the block storage layout for faster reads. This breaking change necessitates existing indexes to be
  recreated.
- Significantly improved `VACUUM` times when the table contains updated or deleted rows - `VACUUM`ing one million
  updated rows went from 20 minutes to 0.8 seconds.

## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- Fixed a bug where datetime values with sub-second precision were truncated to second precision.
- Fixed an issue where `VACUUM`s could not receive `SIGINT`s.
- Fixed concurrency issues around concurrent `UPDATE`, `VACUUM`, and parallel custom scans.

## New Contributors ðŸ‘‹
