## Stability Improvements 💪

We uncovered and fixed a bug where segment merging could silently fail on every transaction. This caused the segment count to grow
unbounded, which degraded search performance and ballooned the index size. In ParadeDB Enterprise, it also interfered with logical replication, causing
the replica to fall behind since the silently-failing merge operations added overhead to every transaction.

As part of fixing this issue, we also uncovered several areas of improvement to our index's concurrency controls and write throughput.
