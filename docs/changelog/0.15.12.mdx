## New Features ðŸ”¥

- Introduced `paradedb.force_merge()` which allows you to merge segments into an arbitrary layer size without changing the index's layer sizes. This
  is useful for merging into very large segment sizes (e.g. `>100MB`), because those merges are very expensive and can degrade write throughput if done at
  insert time.

## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- Fixed an issue where any long-running transaction could prevent segment recycling across all BM25 indexes, which led to increased index size
  and lowered write throughput. For instance, running a `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` on one index could negatively affect other indexes.

- Fixed an issue where `VACUUM` could be blocked indefinitely by a previously-cancelled merge.
