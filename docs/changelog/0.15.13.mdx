## Performance Improvements ðŸš€

- Improved `paradedb.force_merge` to consume less memory and disk I/O by merging segments serially instead of in parallel, and to
  recycle segments as they're being merged.

## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- Metadata functions like `paradedb.index_info` now work over partitioned tables.
- Granted `SELECT` permissions to `PUBLIC` to `paradedb.index_layer_info`
