## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- In ParadeDB Enterprise, fixed an issue with physical replication where read replicas would sometimes error if a WAL record was being concurrently applied
- Deprecated the `raw` tokenizer in favor of the new `keyword` tokenizer, which fixes an issue where `raw` was lowercasing tokens
- Fixed an issue where segments created by `CREATE INDEX` could get merged in the next `INSERT/UPDATE` if they were under the max layer size,
  which could be a very expensive operation

## Performance Improvements ðŸš€

- Landed some initial work on improving the query performance of partitioned indexes by pushing down `ORDER BY...LIMIT`
