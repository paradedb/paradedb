## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- Fixed an issue where the custom scan would throw an error instead of gracefully falling back to an index scan when boolean predicates were used
- Fixed an issue where joins with the `@@@` operator could exclude results from the output
- Fixed an issue where "Top N" queries could enter an endless loop if enough documents in a segment had been deleted
- Fixed an issue where the custom scan would solve an incorrect boolean condition if there were parentheses involved in the query
- Fixed an issue where `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` setting was not being respected by parallel scans

## Performance Improvements ðŸš€

- Reduced index size and improved write throughput by eliminating some extra write overhead
- The custom scan can now use fast fields when both string and numeric fields are present in the output columns

## New Features ðŸŽ‰

- Introduced `paradedb.snippet_positions` which returns the byte offsets of highlighted text
- Introduced support for the Jieba tokenizer
