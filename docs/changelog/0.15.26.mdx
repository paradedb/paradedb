## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- Fixed one more remaining issue with "Top N" queries where they could return the wrong order for strings or UUIDs
- Fixed an issue with `paradedb.aggregate` where it could distribute segments across workers unevenly if `parallel_leader_participation` was enabled
- Fixed an issue with `ORDER BY` range fields not working
