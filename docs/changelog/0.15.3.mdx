## New Features ðŸŽ‰

- Updated the index tuning settings for memory and parallelism to no longer be restricted to superuser privileges.

## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- Fixed an issue where `paradedb.score()` returned empty values when using parametrized queries/plans.
- Fixed an issue where text `key_field` values would get truncated to 255 characters. If you are using a text key field, you must `REINDEX`.
- Fixed an issue with `paradedb.term()` could not find docs matching a full UUID value.
- Fixed an issue where the ICU tokenizer would block inserts if `libicu72` was installed.
- Fixed an issue where, if ParadeDB was running as a logical replica, bulk insert/update statements would take too long and cause the replication stream to freeze.

## Performance Improvements ðŸš€

- Improved our segment merge policy such that a more optimal segment layout is created when the index experiences frequent inserts/updates
