<Note>
  In order for the TEXT `key_field` fix to apply, existing BM25 indexes must be

## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- Fixed an issue where TEXT `key_field` values would get truncated to 255 characters.
- Fixed an issue with `paradedb.term()` could not find docs matching a full UUID value.
- Fixed an issue where the ICU tokenizer could lock the BM25 index.
