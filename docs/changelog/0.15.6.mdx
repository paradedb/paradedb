## Performance Improvements ðŸš€

- Significantly improves segment merge speeds, leading to 10-15X higher `INSERT`/`UPDATE` throughput in our testing and more optimal segment counts
- Support for basic predicate pushdown: `<`, `>`, `=`, etc. predicates get "pushed down" to the BM25 index when used alonside an `@@@`

## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- Fixed a compatibility issue between `pg_search` and `pg_ivm`
