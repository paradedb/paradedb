title: 0.16.0
---

`0.16.0` does **not** contain breaking changes to existing indexes. However, several settings around index creation have been changed.
Please read the changelog carefully.

## New Features ðŸŽ‰

- `CREATE INDEX`/`REINDEX` can now leverage Postgres parallel workers, which significantly improves index build times. To fully take advantage
  of parallel index builds, some [Postgres settings](/documentation/configuration/index) may require tuning. Additionally, the old `paradedb.create_index_*` and `paradedb.statement_*` settings have been removed in favor of the built-in
  `postgresql.conf` settings.
- Indexing expressions is a new beta feature for advanced users.
- `paradedb.snippet` now works for JSON.

## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- Fixed an issue where BM25 scores could be lost in JOIN queries.

## Performance Improvements ðŸš€

- Optimized the insert code path, leading to 2X write throughput over single-row inserts/updates.
- Improved query pushdown to use the BM25 index when we can, even if `@@@` is not present in the query.
