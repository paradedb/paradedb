## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- Fixed an issue where our custom scan pushdown code would discard some predicates if the query also contained a subselect
- Fixed an issue where having too many segments would consume too much memory
- In ParadeDB Enterprise, fixed an error that could cause a parallel `CREATE INDEX` to terminate early

## New Features ðŸŽ‰

- The `inet` type can now be BM25 indexed

## Performance Improvements ðŸš€

- Optimized query performance for scenarios where there are many (i.e. several hundred plus) segments in an index
- Operations over scalar arrays like `IN` are now pushed down to the BM25 index, if the field is fast
