## Performance Improvements ðŸš€

- Single-row write throughput is now doubled compared to `0.15.26`, due to a combination of
  performance optimizations and fixing a regression introduced in `0.16.0`

## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- Unconditional query pushdown, introduced in `0.16.0`, has been disabled by default due to a number
  of corner cases uncovered after its release. To re-enable it (not recommended):

```sql
SET paradedb.enable_custom_scan_without_operator = on;
```
