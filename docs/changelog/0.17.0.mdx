## Pushdown for `COUNT`

We're making rapid progress on our [roadmap](/welcome/roadmap#analytics) to fully push down aggregates to the BM25 index. The first aggregate we've pushed down
is `COUNT`.

This feature is in beta. To test it, first enable the feature flag:

```sql
SET paradedb.enable_aggregate_custom_scan TO ON;
```

With this feature enabled, any `COUNT` queries over a single table (no `JOIN`s yet) where `@@@` is present will be pushed down:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes';
```

<Accordion title="Expected Output">
```csv
                                                                      QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Custom Scan (ParadeDB Aggregate Scan) on mock_items  (cost=0.00..0.00 rows=0 width=8)
   Index: search_idx
   Tantivy Query: {"with_index":{"query":{"parse_with_field":{"field":"description","query_string":"shoes","lenient":null,"conjunction_mode":null}}}}
   Aggregate Definition: {"0":{"value_count":{"field":"ctid"}}}
(4 rows)
```
</Accordion>

More aggregates (`SUM`, `COUNT(DISTINCT)`, `GROUP BY`, etc.) are on their way!

## Background Merging

Prior to this release, the compaction, or merging, of the index [LSM tree](/welcome/architecture#lsm-tree) happened in the foreground, blocking
`INSERT`/`UPDATE` transactions. While this is acceptable for smaller layers of the LSM tree, merging large layers can block transactions for
long period of time.

With this release, merging large layers happens in the background. This is configurable with the `background_layer_sizes` [index option](/documentation/configuration/segment_size#background-layer-sizes)
and delivers significant improvements to write throughput for update-heavy tables.

## Custom Free Space Map

Prior to this release, the BM25 index relied on the built-in Postgres [free space map (FSM)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-fsm.html) to reclaim
space during compaction. However, the Postgres FSM is not write-ahead logged. This means that if the instance terminates (i.e. during a failover), the FSM
can get lost, preventing dead space in the index from being reclaimed by future writes.

To solve this, we implemented our own, write-ahead logged free space map that lives alongside the BM25 index. This FSM is also more optimized than the Postgres
FSM for bulk writes, which has improved disk write patterns.

The full changelog is available [here](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.17.0).
