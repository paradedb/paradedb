## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- There are no changes in this release for ParadeDB Community. The purpose of this release is a bug fix in ParadeDB Enterprise -- we addressed an issue where,
  during the upgrade process from `0.16.4` to `0.17.0`, ParadeDB hot standbys could go out of sync with the primary, causing read queries to those standbys to
  fail until the primary updated.

The full changelog is available [here](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.17.1).
