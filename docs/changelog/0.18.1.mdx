## New Features 🎉

- Introduced the ability to add [slop](/documentation/full-text/phrase#slop) to phrase queries in v2 of the API
- Support aggregates over JSON with `paradedb.enable_aggregate_custom_scan` turned on

## Stability Improvements 💪

- Fixed an error where, with `paradedb.enable_aggregate_custom_scan` turned on, ordering by an aggregate would error
- Fixed an error where Top N queries would error if there were null values
- Fixed an issue where custom scans would fail if they contained a subquery

The full changelog is available [on the GitHub Release](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.18.1).
