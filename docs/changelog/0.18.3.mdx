## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- Fixed an issue where queries with nested `OR EXISTS` clauses or multiple `JOIN`s would throw an `rt_fetch used out-of-bounds` error

## Performance Improvements ðŸš€

- Pushed down `GROUP BY...ORDER BY...LIMIT` queries to the custom aggregate scan
- Improved write throughput by roughly 20% by swapping out our custom buffered writer for Rust's standard `BufWriter`
