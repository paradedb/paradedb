## Stability Improvements 💪

- Fixed an issue where queries that filtered over non-indexed values could leak memory
- On ParadeDB Enterprise, fixed an issue where hot standbys could experience a high number of query cancels due to replication conflict false positives

The full changelog is available [on the GitHub Release](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.18.4).
