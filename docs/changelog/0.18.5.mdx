## Performance Improvements 🚀

- Introduced two new settings, `paradedb.topn_retry_scale_factor` and `paradedb.max_topn_chunk_size`, which can be used to reduce the number of re-queries during a TopN
  when the index has lots of dead entries

## Stability Improvements 💪

- We now allow text key fields to use the `keyword` tokenizer
- Fixed an index corruption issue related to the free space map

The full changelog is available [on the GitHub Release](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.18.5).
