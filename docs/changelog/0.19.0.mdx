## New Features ðŸŽ‰

### Broadened Aggregate Pushdown Support

The [custom aggregate scan](/documentation/aggregates) has pushdown support for several new query types. The first is `FILTER`,
which is analogous to the Elastic filters aggregation. It allows a single query to efficiently collect aggregates over multiple
`WHERE` clauses:

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE category @@@ 'electronics') AS electronics,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE category @@@ 'books') AS books,
  AVG(price) FILTER (WHERE status @@@ 'available') AS avg_available_price
FROM products
GROUP BY brand;
```

The second is pushdown support for `COALESCE` within an aggregate:

```sql
SELECT AVG(COALESCE(price, 0)) FROM products WHERE status @@@ 'available';
```

And the third is support for `COUNT` over a specific field (previously, only `COUNT(*)` was pushed down):

```sql
SELECT COUNT(price) FROM products WHERE status @@@ 'available';
```

### Logical Replication Support

Previously, logical replication was an enterprise-only feature. We have made this feature available in ParadeDB Community,
which means that ParadeDB Community can now run as a logical replica.

<Note>Logical replication in ParadeDB is supported for PG17+ only.</Note>

## Performance Improvements ðŸš€

### Write Throughput

We have made significant improvements to ParadeDB's write throughput, especially for single-row updates. The first change is a new
["mutable segment" data structure](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/pull/3203), designed to incur the minimal possible overhead during a single-row write. The overhead of tokenizing,
serializing, and flushing an immutable segment is now completely gone for these single-row writes.

The second is a new [free space map data structure](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/pull/3252), backed by an AVL tree. This data structure was designed to minimize lock contention
during heavy, concurrent writes.

The full changelog is available [here](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.19.0).
