## Stability Improvements 💪

- Fixed a backwards compatibility issue with the `keyword` tokenizer, where indexes created before `0.19.0` with
  this tokenizer would fail to accept writes after the upgrade because the internal name of the tokenizer was changed
- Fixed an issue where blocks could get added to the free space map twice, leading to undefined behavior like page corruption
  or hangs

The full changelog is available [on the GitHub Release](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.19.2).
