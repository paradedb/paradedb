## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- Fixed a backwards compatibility issue with the `keyword` tokenizer, where indexes created before `0.19.0` with
  this tokenizer would fail to accept writes after the upgrade because the internal name of the tokenizer was changed

The full changelog is available [here](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.19.2).
