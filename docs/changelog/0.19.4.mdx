## Stability Improvements ðŸ’ª

- Fixed an issue where `CREATE INDEX` would lead to larger than necessary indexes because free space was not being reused effectively
- Fixed a bug on ParadeDB Community where writes would get blocked on primaries with hot standbys attached

The full changelog is available [on the GitHub Release](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.19.4).
