## Stability Improvements 💪

- Brought back the deprecated `paradedb.score` and `paradedb.snippet` functions so existing queries aren't broken (these
  functions have been renamed in the [v2 API](/documentation/sorting/score))
- Fixed a bug in the free space map where the data structure could become very sparse, leading to unnecessary page reads
- Fixed a bug where snippet generation was broken for the `pdb.unicode_words` tokenizer

The full changelog is available [on the GitHub Release](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.19.5).
