## Stability Improvements 💪

- Correctly support correlated subqueries with the aggregate custom scan enabled
- Fixed an issue where TopN queries with an `UNNEST` would not receive a TopN query plan
- Fixed a race condition that caused prepared statements to return incorrect results
- Fixed an issue where `varchar[]` arrays could not be indexed

## New Features 🚀

- Added an optional [toggle](/documentation/aggregates/facets#faceted-performance-optimization) to faceted queries to disable visibility checks, which can improve
  query times by 2-4X at the expense of correctness

The full changelog is available [on the GitHub Release](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.20.1).
