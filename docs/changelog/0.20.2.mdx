## Stability Improvements 💪

- Added a missing upgrade script for the `pdb.agg` function
- Fixed a bug where updating large text or JSON values that have been "toasted" (i.e. compressed) by Postgres
  could cause corrupt reads

## New Features 🚀

- Non-text expressions like integers and integer arrays can now be [indexed](/documentation/indexing/indexing-expressions#indexing-non-text-expressions)

The full changelog is available [on the GitHub Release](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.20.2).
