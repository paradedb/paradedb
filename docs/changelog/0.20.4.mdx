## Stability Improvements 💪

- Fixed a bug where, if a hard-coded value was present in the target list and a custom scan was triggered, the result table could have the value incorrectly set to null
- Fixed an issue where aliased non-text fields needed to have the same name as the Postgres field in order to be pushed down to the custom scan
- If an invalid field name is passed to `pdb.agg`, an error is thrown instead of an empty result being returned
- Fixed incorrect `NULL` positioning when using `NULLS FIRST/NULLS LAST` with `ORDER BY` in aggregate custom scans

The full changelog is available [on the GitHub Release](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.20.4).
