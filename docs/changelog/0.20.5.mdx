## Stability Improvements 💪

- Fixed a bug introduced in `0.20.2` where query cancels could cause a crash
- Fixed an issue where background merges would get kicked off over `INVALID` indexes still being indexed `CONCURRENTLY`,
  causing index creation to take longer than necessary
- Fixed an upstream bug in Tantivy where `CREATE INDEX` could fail due to overflow of variable-length encoded integers

The full changelog is available [on the GitHub Release](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.20.5).
