## Stability Improvements 💪

- Fixed an issue where the `unicode_words` tokenizer was named incorrectly in the output of `paradedb.schema`
- Fixed a compatibility issue with Citus
- Fixed an issue where casting to `pdb.alias` could cause a crash
- Fixed an issue where expressions that were not indexed could get incorrectly pushed down to the index

The full changelog is available [on the GitHub Release](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.20.6).
