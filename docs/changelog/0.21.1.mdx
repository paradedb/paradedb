## Stability Improvements 💪

- Fixed an intermittent issue where parallel index scans in hash join scenarios return zero results instead
- Fixed a crash that occurs when executing prepared statements with parallel hash joins on BM25 indexes after PostgreSQL switches to a generic plan
- Return an error instead of silently returning the wrong results if a phrase or proximity query is executed over a field that was not indexed with positions

## Performance Improvements 🚀

- `WHERE` clauses with functions that return boolean results are now more efficiently executed by the index
