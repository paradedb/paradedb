## Stability Improvements 💪

- Fixed an issue introduced in `0.21.0` where users would get an error that `zstd-compression` was not enabled. This was caused by
  an upstream change in Tantivy that disabled `zstd-compression` by default.

The full changelog is available [on the GitHub Release](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.21.2).
