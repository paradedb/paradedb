## Stability Improvements 💪

- Fixed an issue where merging would take too many locks, causing merges to get blocked
- Fixed an issue where JSON paths passed into `pdb.agg` would error
- Fixed a missing upgrade script for `pdb.icu`
- Fixed an issue where JSON fields cast to a tokenizer would get indexed as text, not JSON

## New Features 🎉

- [Positions](/tokenizers/available-tokenizers/ngrams#phrase-and-proximity-queries-with-ngram) are supported for some ngram tokenizers
- `= ANY()` pushdown is supported for text array fields that have been indexed with `pdb.literal`

The full changelog is available [on the GitHub Release](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.21.3).
