## Stability Improvements 💪

- Fixed an issue where `ORDER BY lower()` was not getting an optimized Top N scan if `lower()` was literal normalized
- Fixed a rare `u32` overflow issue that could cause queries to fail over large segments
- Fixed an issue where [filter pushdown](/documentation/filtering) did not happen if non-text fields appeared after text fields in the index definition
- Fixed an issue where `GROUP BY` queries over datetime fields would error with `paradedb.enable_aggregate_custom_scan` enabled

## Performance Improvements 🚀

Improved the filtering performance of partial indexes. For example, in the following query `deleted_at IS NULL`
gets fully pushed down to the index.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx ON profiles USING bm25 (...) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE headline ||| 'recruteur' AND deleted_at IS NULL;
```
