## Stability Improvements 💪

- Fixed an issue with upgrading from `0.20.10` to `0.21.x` on Redhat
- Fixed an issue where including `pg_search` in `shared_preload_libraries` but not installing it could cause a `schema paradedb not found` error

The full changelog is available [on the GitHub Release](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/tag/v0.21.7).
