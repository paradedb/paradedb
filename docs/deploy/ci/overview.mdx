ParadeDB can be added to a GitHub Actions workflow as a [service container](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/using-containerized-services/about-service-containers) in the job
definition. Service containers are additional containers started in a workflow to provide necessary services (like databases) that a job depends on. These containers run alongside the job container or
the runner (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`) and can be connected to on localhost.
