<Note>
  Cloud platform deployments run ParadeDB Community, which does not include WAL support. This makes them suitable for
  hobby, development, and staging environments. For production, we recommend [ParadeDB Enterprise](/welcome/enterprise)
  deployed via [Kubernetes](/deploy/self-hosted/kubernetes) or [BYOC](/deploy/byoc).
</Note>

[Render](https://render.com) is a cloud platform that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications. The
[ParadeDB Render template](https://github.com/paradedb/deployment-render) provides a one-click deployment
that runs ParadeDB Community as a private service with persistent SSD storage.

## One-Click Deploy

The fastest way to get started is to click the button below, which will fork the template repository and deploy
ParadeDB to your Render account.

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to configure the deployment yourself:

1. Fork the [deployment-render](https://github.com/paradedb/deployment-render) repository
2. In the Render dashboard, create a new **Private Service** and connect your forked repository
3. Select **Docker** as the runtime
4. Attach a **Disk** of at least 10 GB mounted at `/var/lib/postgresql`
5. Set the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `POSTGRES_USER` | Database user | `postgres` |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Database password | Auto-generated |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | Database name | `paradedb` |

## Connecting to ParadeDB

ParadeDB runs as a **private service** on Render, which means it is not exposed to the public internet. You can
connect from other services on your Render account via the internal network:

```bash
psql -h paradedb -U postgres -d paradedb
```

To connect from your local machine, set up [Render SSH](https://docs.render.com/ssh) and then run:

```bash
psql -U postgres paradedb
```
