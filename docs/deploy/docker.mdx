<Note>
  We do not recommend running the ParadeDB Docker image in production, as it
  does not provide [high availability](/deploy/high-availability).
</Note>

To deploy ParadeDB via Docker, pull and run the `paradedb/paradedb` image locally. This is the recommended deployment method for
testing and development.

```bash
docker run \
  --name paradedb \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase \
  -v paradedb_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/ \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d \
  paradedb/paradedb:latest
```

You may replace `myuser`, `mypassword`, and `mydatabase` with whatever values you want. These will be your database
connection credentials.

The `paradedb/paradedb:latest` tag uses Postgres 17. Docker images are available for Postgres 13+. To specify a different Postgres version, please refer to the available tags on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/paradedb/paradedb/tags).

To connect to ParadeDB, install the `psql` client and run

```bash
docker exec -it paradedb psql -U myuser -d mydatabase -W
```
