<Info>
**Footnotes**

<p className="text-sm">
  1. The BM25 index supports Postgres' multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)
  rules. The index reflects the current state of the underlying table at all
  times, changes to the index are atomic, and queries are transactionally
  consistent with the table.
  2. The BM25 index is built on block storage, Postgres' native storage API.
  This means that it leverages the Postgres buffer cache, which minimizes disk
  I/O.
  3. All listed deployment features and limitations are specific to the BM25 index. For instance,
  ParadeDB Community supports physical/logical replication, crash recovery, etc. for heap tables and other Postgres indexes like B-Tree.
