There are two ways to deploy ParadeDB: self-hosting ParadeDB or using ParadeDB BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud).

## Self-Hosted ParadeDB

For hobby environments, ParadeDB Community can be deployed as a [Docker image](/deploy/self-hosted/docker),
inside [Kubernetes](/deploy/self-hosted/kubernetes), or as an [extension](/deploy/self-hosted/extensions) inside an existing self-hosted Postgres.

For production environments, we recommend deploying the [ParadeDB Enterprise](/deploy/enterprise) binary inside Kubernetes. This unlocks support for
[logical replication](/deploy/self-hosted/logical-replication) and [high availability](/deploy/self-hosted/high-availability), which must be configured separately.

## ParadeDB BYOC

[ParadeDB BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud)](/deploy/byoc) is a managed deployment of ParadeDB Enterprise inside your AWS, GCP, or Azure account.
