There are two ways to deploy ParadeDB: [self-hosting ParadeDB](/deploy/self-hosted) or using [ParadeDB BYOC](/deploy/byoc) (Bring Your Own Cloud).

## Self-Hosted ParadeDB

For hobby, development, or staging environments, [ParadeDB Community](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb) can be deployed as a [Docker image](/deploy/self-hosted/docker),
inside [Kubernetes](/deploy/self-hosted/kubernetes), or as an [extension](/deploy/self-hosted/extension) inside an existing self-hosted Postgres.

For production environments, we recommend deploying the [ParadeDB Enterprise](/deploy/enterprise) binary inside Kubernetes. This unlocks support for
[logical replication](/deploy/self-hosted/logical-replication) and [high availability](/deploy/self-hosted/high-availability), which must be configured separately.

<Note>
Running ParadeDB Community in a production application that serves paying customers is discouraged.

This is because ParadeDB Community [does not have write-ahead log (WAL) support](/deploy/enterprise). Without WALs, data can be lost or corrupted if
the server crashes or restarts, which would necessitate a reindex and incur downtime for your application. For more details, see [guarantees](/welcome/guarantees#aci-d).

When you are ready to deploy in ParadeDB to production, [contact us](mailto:sales@paradedb.com) for access to ParadeDB Enterprise, which has WAL support.

</Note>

## ParadeDB BYOC

[ParadeDB BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud)](/deploy/byoc) is a managed deployment of ParadeDB Enterprise inside your AWS or GCP account.
Please [contact sales](mailto:sales@paradedb.com) for access.
