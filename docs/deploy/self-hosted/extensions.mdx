title: Extensions
---

<Note>
  If you are self-hosting, we do not recommend installing ParadeDB in your
  primary Postgres. ParadeDB is designed to run as a [logical
  replica](/deploy/self-hosted/logical-replication) of your primary, which
  isolates search and analytical workloads from your primary.
</Note>

If you already self-manage Postgres, you may prefer to install ParadeDB directly within your self-managed
Postgres instead of deploying the ParadeDB Helm chart.

This can be done by installing the two extensions that ParadeDB uses:

- The `pg_search` extension powers all of ParadeDB's [full text search and analytics](/documentation).
- The `pg_analytics` extension powers ParadeDB's [integrations](/integrations).

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have superuser access to the Postgres database.

Next, install `libicu`.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04
sudo apt-get install -y libicu70
```

```bash Ubuntu 24.04
sudo apt-get install -y libicu74
```

## Install the ParadeDB Postgres Extensions

### ParadeDB Community

ParadeDB provides prebuilt binaries for our extensions on

- Debian 12
- Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9
- macOS 14 (Sonoma) and 15 (Sequoia)

Postgres 14, 15, 16, and 17 are available. If you are using a different version of Postgres or a different operating system, you will need to build the extensions from source.

#### pg_search

The prebuilt releases can be found in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/latest).

<Note>
  You can replace `0.15.0` with the `pg_search` version you wish to install and
  `17` with the version of Postgres you are using.

### ParadeDB Enterprise

If you are a [ParadeDB Enterprise](/deploy/enterprise) user, you should have received a copy of the enterprise binaries. Please [contact sales](mailto:sales@paradedb.com) for access.

## Update `postgresql.conf`

Next, add the extension(s) to `shared_preload_libraries` in `postgresql.conf`.

```ini
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_search,pg_analytics'
```

Reload the Postgres server for these changes to take effect.

## Load the Extensions

Finally, connect to your Postgres database via your client of choice (e.g. `psql`) and run the following command:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_search;
CREATE EXTENSION pg_analytics;
```

<Note>
  `pg_search` can be combined with `pgvector` for hybrid search. You can find
  the instructions for installing `pgvector`
  [here](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
