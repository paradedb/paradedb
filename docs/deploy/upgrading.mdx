title: Upgrading ParadeDB
---

## Overview

ParadeDB ships all of its functionality via Postgres extensions. All updates to ParadeDB can be
received by updating one or more of the following extensions:

1. `pg_search` for full text search and facets
2. `pg_analytics` for querying data lakes

## Getting the Current Version

To inspect the current version of an extension, run the following command.

```sql
-- Get the version of pg_search
SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_search';
-- Get the version of pg_analytics
SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_analytics';
```

## Getting the Latest Version

Because `pg_search`, `pg_analytics`, and `pgvector` are independent extensions, they each have their own versions.
For the latest available version, please refer to the respective Github repos:

1. [`pg_search`](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases) is on version `0.15.0`
2. [`pg_analytics`](https://github.com/paradedb/pg_analytics/blob/main/pg_analytics.control) is on version `0.3.1`
3. [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/tags) is on version `0.8.0`

## Updating ParadeDB Docker Image

To upgrade the ParadeDB Docker image while preserving your data volume:

1. Stop the ParadeDB Docker image via `docker stop paradedb`.

2. Run the following command to pull a specific version of the Docker image. You can set the version number
   to `latest` to pull the latest Docker image. You can find the full list of available tags on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/paradedb/paradedb/tags).

```bash
docker pull paradedb/paradedb:<version_number>
```

The latest version of the Docker image should be `0.15.0`.

3. Start the new ParadeDB Docker image via `docker run paradedb`.

4. Run the following commands to upgrade all extensions to their latest version.

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION pg_search UPDATE TO '0.15.0';
ALTER EXTENSION pg_analytics UPDATE TO '0.3.1';
ALTER EXTENSION vector UPDATE TO '0.8.0';
```

## Updating Extensions

To upgrade the extensions running in a self-managed Postgres:

1. Stop Postgres (e.g. via `pg_ctl stop -D </path/to/data/directory>`)
2. Download and install the extension you wish to upgrade in the same way that it was initially installed (e.g. via cURL)
3. Start Postgres (e.g. via `pg_ctl start -D /usr/local/var/postgres`)
4. Run the following command in every database that has previously run `CREATE EXTENSION <extension_name>`

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION <extension_name> UPDATE TO '<extension_version>';
```
