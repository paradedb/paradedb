title: Upgrading ParadeDB
---

## Overview

ParadeDB ships its functionality inside a Postgres extension, `pg_search`. Upgrading ParadeDB is as simple as updating the `pg_search` extension.

<Note>
  ParadeDB uses `pgvector` for vector search. This extension is not managed by
  ParadeDB. Please refer to the [pgvector
  documentation](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#upgrading)
  for instructions on how to upgrade it.
</Note>

## Getting the Current Version

To inspect the current version of an extension, run the following command.

```sql
SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_search';
```

Verify that it matches `paradedb.version_info()`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM paradedb.version_info();
```

The reason that there are two statements is because `paradedb.version_info()` is the actual version of `pg_search` that is installed,
whereas `pg_extension` is what Postgres' catalog thinks the version of the extension is.

If `paradedb.version_info()` is greater than `pg_extension`, it typically means that `ALTER EXTENSION` was not run after the previous upgrade, and that the SQL upgrade scripts were not applied.
If `pg_extension` is greater than `paradedb.version_info()`, it means that the extension didn't fully upgrade, and that Postgres needs to be restarted.

## Getting the Latest Version

The latest version of `pg_search` is `0.15.16`. Please refer to the [releases](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases) page for all available versions of `pg_search`.

## Updating ParadeDB

### Helm Chart

To upgrade the ParadeDB Helm chart:

1. Update the `paradedb` chart to the latest version.

```bash
helm repo update
```

2. Get the latest version of the `paradedb` chart.

```bash
helm search repo paradedb
```

3. Get the latest version of the ParadeDB extension, which is the value of `version.paradedb` in the chart [README](https://github.com/paradedb/charts/tree/dev/charts/paradedb#values).

4. Run `helm upgrade` with the latest version of the chart and the latest version of the extension.

```bash
helm upgrade paradedb paradedb/paradedb --namespace paradedb --reuse-values --version <helm_version> --set version.paradedb=<paradedb_version> --atomic
```

Replace `<helm_version>` with the latest version of the chart and `<paradedb_version>` with the latest version of the extension.

5. If you are using [ParadeDB BYOC](/deploy/byoc), an automatic rollout will begin. One by one, the pods will be restarted to apply the new version of the extension.

### Docker Image

To upgrade the ParadeDB Docker image while preserving your data volume:

1. Stop the ParadeDB Docker image via `docker stop paradedb`.

2. Run the following command to pull a specific version of the Docker image. You can set the version number
   to `latest` to pull the latest Docker image. You can find the full list of available tags on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/paradedb/paradedb/tags).

```bash
docker pull paradedb/paradedb:0.15.16
```

The latest version of the Docker image should be `0.15.16`.

3. Start the new ParadeDB Docker image via `docker run paradedb`.

### Self-Managed Postgres

To upgrade the extensions running in a self-managed Postgres:

1. Stop Postgres (e.g. `pg_ctl stop -D </path/to/data/directory>`).
2. Download and install the extension you wish to upgrade in the same way that it was initially installed.
3. Start Postgres (e.g. `pg_ctl start -D </path/to/data/directory>`).

## Alter Extension

After ParadeDB has been upgraded, connect to it and run the following command in all databases that `pg_search` is installed in. This step is required regardless of the environment that ParadeDB is installed in (Helm, Docker, or self-managed Postgres).

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION pg_search UPDATE TO '0.15.16';
```

## Verify the Upgrade

After upgrading the extension and restarting Postgres, verify that the version numbers returned by the following commands match:

```sql
SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_search';
SELECT * FROM paradedb.version_info();
```

If the two versions do not match, restart Postgres and try again.
