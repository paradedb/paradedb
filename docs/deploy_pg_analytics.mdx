title: Deploying `pg_analytics`
---

This section will guide you on how to deploy `pg_analytics` as an extension to an existing PostgreSQL database. You must have superuser access to the database to install the extension.

Note: We only provide instructions for deploying on Linux Debian/Ubuntu. If you are using a different version of Linux, please contact [us](mailto:sales@paradedb.com) and we'll be happy to help.

# Step-by-Step Guide

## Prerequisites

The `pg_analytics` extension has no additional dependencies for its standalone functionality. If you would like to create BM25 search indexes on `pg_analytics` tables, you will also need to install
the `pg_search` extension. You can find the instructions for doing so [here](/deploy_pg_search).

## Installing `pg_analytics`

ParadeDB provides pre-built binaries for the `pg_analytics` extension for Postgres 15 and 16, for Ubuntu 22.04. You can find them in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/latest). If you
are using a different version of Postgres or a different operating system, you will need to build the extension from source.

### Using pre-build binaries

```bash
curl -L "https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/download/v0.6.1/pg_analytics-v0.6.1-pg16-arm64-ubuntu2204.deb" -o /tmp/pg_analytics.deb
sudo apt-get install -y /tmp/*.deb
```

Note: You can replace `v0.6.1` with the `pg_analytics` version you wish to install, and `pg16` with the version of Postgres you are using.

### Building from source

You can find the instructions for doing so [here](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/v0.6.1/pg_analytics#installation).

## Updating `postgresql.conf`

To enable `pg_analytics`, you will need to add `pg_analytics` to your `shared_preload_libraries` in your `postgresql.conf` file:

```conf
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_analytics'
```

You will then need to reload your PostgreSQL server for the changes to take effect.

## Loading the Extension

Once the extension binary is installed on your system, connect to your Postgres database via your client of choice (e.g. `psql`) and run the following command:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_analytics;
```

That's it! You're all set to use `pg_analytics` in your database. To get started, we suggest you follow the [quickstart guide](/search/quickstart).
