title: "On a Cloud Instance"
---

<Warning>
  Currently, only Postgres-to-ElasticSearch real-time data streams are
  supported. The Retake team is actively adding support for other streams. [Join
  the waitlist](https://retake.typeform.com/to/JTcYtLay) to be notified when
  it's ready.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

- The instance should have at least of 4GB memory.
- The instance must expose a port for Kafka. By default, port `9094` is used. For more information, refer to the
  `docker-compose.yml` file for the recommended configuration.
- The computer must expose a port for Schema Registry. By default, port `8081` is used. For more information, refer to the
  `docker-compose.yml` file for the recommended configuration.
- Your source must be properly configred. Refer to the [Setup](/deployment/setup) page for configuration details.

## Instructions

1. SSH into your cloud instance.

2. Run the deploy script. It will use the `main` branch by default, but you
   can configure this with the `--branch` option. This will clone the repo,
   install the necessary dependencies, and spin up the real-time server inside a
   Docker container.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getretake/retake/main/deploy.sh | bash
```

If the containers start successfully, should see the following logs:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                     NAMES                      COMMAND                   CREATED         STATUS                            PORTS

```

3. Confirm the `retake-consumer` has successfully created the config topics:

```bash
docker compose logs consumer
```

You should see the following logs:

```bash
retake-consumer-1  | Topic _connector_config created
retake-consumer-1  | Topic _config_success created
```

4. That's it - the real-time server is now running and ready to receive requests! [Use the SDK](/quickstart/real-time-update) to connect
   to the server and configure real-time-updates.
