title: All
---

## Basic Usage

`all` indiscriminately matches every document in the index, assigning a uniform score of `1.0` to each. `all` is typically used in conjunction with `paradedb.boolean` queries. If `paradedb.boolean` contains only `must_not`, then `all` needs to be provided
to form a result set for `must_not` to filter over.

```sql Function Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.boolean(
    should => ARRAY[paradedb.all()],
    must_not => ARRAY[paradedb.term('description', 'shoes')]
);
```

```sql JSON Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@
'{
    "boolean": {
        "should": [{"all": null}],
        "must_not": [{"term": {"field": "description", "value": "shoes"}}]
    }
}'::jsonb;
```
