title: Const Score
---

## Basic Usage

Applies a constant score across all documents matched by the underlying query. It can avoid unnecessary score computation on the wrapped query.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.boolean(
  should => ARRAY[
    paradedb.const_score(1.0, paradedb.term('description', 'shoes')),
    paradedb.term('description', 'running')
  ]
);
```

<ParamField body="score" required>
  The constant score to use for each result.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query" required>
  The query to perform.
</ParamField>
