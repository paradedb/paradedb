title: Tantivy Query String
---

## Basic Usage

Tantivy comes with its own [string-based query language](https://docs.rs/tantivy/latest/tantivy/query/struct.QueryParser.html).

`paradedb.parse` accepts Tantivy query strings, which is useful for concisely expressing complex queries or directly executing queries provided
by the end user. For instance, the following two queries are equivalent:

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.parse('description:"running shoes" OR category:footwear');

SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.boolean(should => ARRAY[
    paradedb.phrase('description', ARRAY['running', 'shoes']),
    paradedb.term('category', 'footwear')
]);
```

## Lenient Query Parsing

By default, `paradedb.parse` uses strict syntax parsing. This means that if any part of the query does not conform to Tantivy's query string syntax, the query fails.
For instance, a valid field name must be provided before every query (i.e. `category:footwear`).

Lenient query parsing executes the query on a best-effort basis. For example, the following query executes even though no fields were specified.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.parse('speaker electronics', lenient => true);
```

## Conjunction Mode

By default, queries in the query string are `OR`ed together. For instance, the following two queries are equivalent:

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.parse('description:speaker category:electronics');

SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.parse('description:speaker OR category:electronics');
```

With `conjunction_mode` set to `true`, queries are `AND`ed together. This means that the following two queries are equivalent:

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.parse(
  'description:speaker category:electronics',
  conjunction_mode => true
);

SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.parse(
  'description:speaker AND category:electronics'
);
```

## Parse with Field

`paradedb.parse_with_field` takes a field name and a query string without field names. It's useful for executing user-provided query
strings over specific fields. Like `paradedb.parse`, `lenient` and `conjunction_mode` can be passed to this function.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.parse_with_field(
  'description',
  'speaker electronics',
  conjunction_mode => true
);
```
