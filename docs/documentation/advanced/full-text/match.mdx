## Basic Usage

`paradedb.match` is ParadeDB's standard full text query. It tokenizes a query string and searches for matches against a specified field,
allowing for custom tokenizers and fuzzy matching.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Function Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.match('description', 'running shoes');
```
```sql JSON Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@
'{
    "match": {
        "field": "description",
        "value": "running shoes"
    }
}'::jsonb;
```
</CodeGroup>

<div className="mt-8" />

<ParamField body="field" required>
  Specifies the field within the document to search for the term.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="value" required>
  Defines the phrase you are searching for within the specified field. This
  phrase is automatically tokenized in the same way as `field`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="tokenizer">
  By default, the query string is tokenized in the same way as the field was at
  index time. This can be configured by setting a [custom
  tokenizer](#custom-tokenizer).
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="distance" default={0}>
  If greater than zero, fuzzy matching is applied. Configures the maximum
  Levenshtein distance (i.e. single character edits) allowed to consider a term
  in the index as a match for the query term. Maximum value is `2`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="transpose_cost_one" default={true}>
  When set to `true` and fuzzy matching is enabled, transpositions (swapping two
  adjacent characters) as a single edit in the Levenshtein distance calculation,
  while `false` considers it two separate edits (a deletion and an insertion).
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="prefix" default={false}>
  When set to `true` and fuzzy matching is enabled, the initial substring
  (prefix) of the query term is exempted from the fuzzy edit distance
  calculation, while false includes the entire string in the calculation.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="match_all_terms" default={false}>
  When set to `true`, **all** tokens of the query have to match in order for a
  document to be considered a match. For instance, the query `running shoes` is
  by default executed as `running OR shoes`, but setting `match_all_terms` to
  `true` executes it as `running AND shoes`.
</ParamField>

## Custom Tokenizer

`paradedb.tokenizer` can be passed to `tokenizer` to control how the query string is tokenized.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Function Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.match(
    'description',
    'running shoes',
    tokenizer => paradedb.tokenizer('whitespace')
);
```
```sql JSON Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@
'{
    "match": {
        "field": "description",
        "value": "running shoes",
        "tokenizer": {"type": "whitespace", "lowercase": true, "remove_long": 255}
    }
}'::jsonb;
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
For JSON syntax, use `paradedb.tokenizer` to retrieve the equivalent tokenizer configuration.

```sql
SELECT paradedb.tokenizer('whitespace');
```

</Note>

## Fuzzy Matching

When `distance` is set to a positive integer, fuzzy matching is applied. This allows `match` to tolerate typos in the query string.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Function Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.match('description', 'ruining shoez', distance => 2);
```
```sql JSON Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@
'{
    "match": {
        "field": "description",
        "value": "ruining shoez",
        "distance": 2
    }
}'::jsonb;
```
</CodeGroup>

## Match All Terms

By default, `match` constructs an `OR` boolean query from the query string's tokens. For instance, the query `running shoes` is executed as `running OR shoes`.

When set to `true`, `match_all_terms` constructs an `AND` boolean query instead.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Function Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.match('description', 'running shoes', match_all_terms => true);
```
```sql JSON Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@
'{
    "match": {
        "field": "description",
        "value": "running shoes",
        "match_all_terms": true
    }
}'::jsonb;
```
