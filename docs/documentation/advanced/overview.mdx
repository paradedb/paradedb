## Basic Usage

The right-hand side of the `@@@` operator accepts `JSONB` query objects. For instance, the following code block performs a fuzzy term search.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ '{"fuzzy_term": {"field": "description", "value": "shoez"}}'::jsonb;
```

<Note>
  The query object must be explicitly cast to `JSONB` using `::jsonb`.
</Note>

<Note>
  JSON syntax queries can accept datetime values as strings. To disambiguate
  these from string values, you should set `"is_datetime": true` in the query
  parameters.
</Note>

## Query Builder Functions

In addition to `JSONB`, the right-hand side of the `@@@` operator also accepts query builder functions. The following query is equivalent to the query written above:

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.fuzzy_term('description', 'shoez');
```

All code blocks in this section provide both function and JSON syntax. These two syntaxes are interchangeable, giving you the freedom to decide what's easier for your application to write.
