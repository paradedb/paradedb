title: Regex Phrase
---

## Basic Usage

`regex_phrase` is to matches a specific sequence of regex queries. It is similar to `phrase` but allows for more flexibility in the query.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Function Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.regex_phrase('description', ARRAY['.*nning', '.*oes']);
```
```sql JSON Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@
'{
    "regex_phrase": {
        "field": "description",
        "values": [".*nning", ".*oes"]
    }
}'::jsonb;
```
</CodeGroup>

<div className="mt-8" />

<ParamField body="field" required>
  Specifies the field within the document to search for the term.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="phrases" required>
  An `ARRAY` of regex queries that the search is looking to match.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="slop" default={0}>
  A slop of `0` requires the terms to appear exactly as they are in the phrase
  and adjacent to each other. Higher slop values allow for more distance between
  the terms.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="max_expansions">
  Limits the number of term variations that the prefix can expand to during the
  search. This helps in controlling the breadth of the search by setting a cap
  on how many different terms the prefix can match.
</ParamField>

Setting slop equal to `n` allows `n` terms to come in between the terms in the phrase.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Function Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.regex_phrase('description', ARRAY['.*eek', 'shoes'], slop => 1, max_expansion => 10);
```
```sql JSON Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@
'{
    "regex_phrase": {
        "field": "description",
        "values": [",*eek", "shoes"],
        "slop": 1
        "max_expansion": 10
    }
}'::jsonb;
```
