description: Compute aggregations over multiple filters in one query

The filters aggregation allows a single query to return aggregations for multiple search queries at a time.
To use this aggregation, pass `pdb.agg` to the left-hand side of `FILTER` and a search query to the right-hand side.
For example:

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL
SELECT
    pdb.agg('{"value_count": {"field": "id"}}')
    FILTER (WHERE category === 'electronics') AS electronics_count,
    pdb.agg('{"value_count": {"field": "id"}}')
    FILTER (WHERE category === 'footwear') AS footwear_count
FROM mock_items;
```

```python Django
from paradedb import Agg, ParadeDB, Term

electronics_count = MockItem.objects.filter(
    category=ParadeDB(Term('electronics'))
).aggregate(agg=Agg('{"value_count": {"field": "id"}}'))

footwear_count = MockItem.objects.filter(
    category=ParadeDB(Term('footwear'))
).aggregate(agg=Agg('{"value_count": {"field": "id"}}'))
```

</CodeGroup>

```ini Expected Response
 electronics_count | footwear_count
-------------------+----------------
 {"value": 5.0}    | {"value": 6.0}
(1 row)
```
