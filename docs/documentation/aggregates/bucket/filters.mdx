The filters aggregation allows for a single query to return aggregations for multiple search queries at a time.
For example:

```sql
SELECT
    pdb.agg('{"value_count": {"field": "id"}}') FILTER (WHERE category === 'electronics'),
    pdb.agg('{"value_count": {"field": "id"}}') FILTER (WHERE category === 'footwear')
FROM mock_items;
```
