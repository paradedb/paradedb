title: Configuration
---

Several settings can be tuned to improve the performance of aggregates in ParadeDB.

### Configure Parallel Workers

ParadeDB Enterprise uses Postgres parallel workers. By default, Postgres allows two workers per parallel query.
Increasing the number of [parallel workers](/documentation/configuration/parallel) allows parallel queries to use all of the available hardware on the host machine and can deliver significant
speedups. For instance, if the host machine has 16 CPUs, `max_worker_processes`, `max_parallel_workers`, and `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`
should be set to 16.

<Note>
  Remember to restart Postgres in order for `postgresql.conf` changes to take
  effect.
</Note>

### Run `VACUUM`

`VACUUM` updates the table's [visibility map](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-vm.html),
which speeds up Postgres' visibility checks. Specifying `INDEX_CLEANUP false` allows `VACUUM` to run much
faster over large tables by skipping the cleanup of dead rows in the index.

<Note>Make sure to pass the table name, not the index name, to `VACUUM`.</Note>

```sql
VACUUM (INDEX_CLEANUP false) mock_items;
```

If the table experiences frequent updates, we recommend configuring [autovacuum](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-vacuuming.html).

### Run `pg_prewarm`

The `pg_prewarm` extension can be used to preload data from the index into the Postgres buffer cache, which
improves the response times of "cold" queries (i.e. the first search query after Postgres has restarted).

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_prewarm;
SELECT pg_prewarm('search_idx');
```
