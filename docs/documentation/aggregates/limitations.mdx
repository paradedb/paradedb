## ParadeDB Operator

In order for ParadeDB to push down an aggregate, a ParadeDB text search operator must be present in the query.

```sql
-- Not pushed down
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE rating = 5;

-- Pushed down
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE rating = 5
AND id @@@ pdb.all();
```

If your query does not contain a ParadeDB operator, a way to "force" aggregate pushdown is to append the [all query](/documentation/query-builder/compound/all) to the query's
`WHERE` clause.

## Join Support

ParadeDB is currently only able to push down aggregates over a single table. JOINs are not yet pushed down but are on the [roadmap](/welcome/roadmap).

## NUMERIC Column Precision

For `NUMERIC` columns, aggregate pushdown support depends on the column's declared precision:

| Column Definition              | Aggregate Pushdown | Notes                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `NUMERIC(p,s)` where `p <= 18` | Supported          | Values stored as 64-bit fixed-point integers     |
| `NUMERIC(p,s)` where `p > 18`  | Not supported      | Values stored as sortable bytes (not aggregable) |
| `NUMERIC` (unbounded)          | Not supported      | Values stored as sortable bytes (not aggregable) |

For best performance with `NUMERIC` columns that need aggregate pushdown, declare an explicit precision of 18 or less:

```sql
-- Aggregates can be pushed down
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    price NUMERIC(18,2)  -- precision <= 18
);

-- Aggregates cannot be pushed down (falls back to PostgreSQL)
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    price NUMERIC  -- unbounded precision
);
```

<Note>
  Filter pushdown (equality and range queries) is supported for all `NUMERIC`
  columns regardless of precision. Only aggregate pushdown has the precision
  limitation.
