## `@@@` Operator

In order for ParadeDB to push down an aggregate, the full text search `@@@` operator must be present in the query.

```sql
-- Not pushed down
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE rating = 5;

-- Pushed down
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE rating = 5
AND id @@@ paradedb.all();
```

If your query does not contain the `@@@` operator, a way to "force" aggregate pushdown is to append `AND <key_field> @@@ paradedb.all()` to the query's
`WHERE` clause.

## Join Support

ParadeDB is currently only able to push down aggregates over a single table. JOINs are not yet pushed down but are on the [roadmap](/welcome/roadmap).
