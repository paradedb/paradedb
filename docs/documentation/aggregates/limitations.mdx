## ParadeDB Operator

In order for ParadeDB to push down an aggregate, a ParadeDB text search operator must be present in the query.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL
-- Not pushed down
SELECT COUNT(id) FROM mock_items
WHERE rating = 5;

-- Pushed down
SELECT COUNT(id) FROM mock_items
WHERE rating = 5
AND id @@@ pdb.all();

````

```python Django
from paradedb.search import All, ParadeDB

# Not pushed down — no ParadeDB operator
MockItem.objects.filter(rating=5).count()

# Pushed down — ParadeDB operator triggers aggregate pushdown
MockItem.objects.filter(rating=5, id=ParadeDB(All())).count()
````

</CodeGroup>

If your query does not contain a ParadeDB operator, a way to "force" aggregate pushdown is to append the [all query](/documentation/query-builder/compound/all) to the query's
`WHERE` clause.

## Join Support

ParadeDB is currently only able to push down aggregates over a single table. JOINs are not yet pushed down but are on the [roadmap](/welcome/roadmap).

## NUMERIC Columns

`NUMERIC` columns do not support aggregate pushdown. Queries with aggregates on `NUMERIC` columns will automatically fall back to PostgreSQL for aggregation.

For numeric data that requires aggregate pushdown, use `FLOAT` or `DOUBLE PRECISION` instead:

```sql
-- Aggregates can be pushed down
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    price DOUBLE PRECISION
);

-- Aggregates fall back to PostgreSQL
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    price NUMERIC(10,2)
);
```

<Note>
  Filter pushdown (equality and range queries) is fully supported for all
  `NUMERIC` columns. Only aggregate pushdown is not supported.
