## ParadeDB Operator

In order for ParadeDB to push down an aggregate, a ParadeDB text search operator must be present in the query.

```sql
-- Not pushed down
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE rating = 5;

-- Pushed down
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE rating = 5
AND id @@@ pdb.all();
```

If your query does not contain a ParadeDB operator, a way to "force" aggregate pushdown is to append the [all query](/documentation/query-builder/compound/all) to the query's
`WHERE` clause.

## Join Support

ParadeDB is currently only able to push down aggregates over a single table. JOINs are not yet pushed down but are on the [roadmap](/welcome/roadmap).
