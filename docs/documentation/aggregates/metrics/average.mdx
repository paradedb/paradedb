`AVG` computes the average value over a specific column:

```sql
SELECT AVG(rating) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```

By default, `AVG` ignores null values. Use `COALESCE` to include them in the final average:

```sql
SELECT AVG(COALESCE(rating, 0)) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```

To verify that `AVG` was pushed down, look for a `ParadeDB Aggregate Scan` with `average` in the `EXPLAIN` output:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT AVG(rating) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```
