`AVG` computes the average value over a specific column:

```sql
SELECT pdb.agg('{"avg": {"field": "rating"}}') FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```

```ini Expected Response
              agg
-------------------------------
 {"value": 3.8536585365853657}
(1 row)
```

## SQL Average Syntax

SQL's `AVERAGE` syntax is supported. The following query is equivalent to the above and is executed in the same way.

```sql
SELECT AVG(rating) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```

By default, `AVG` ignores null values. Use `COALESCE` to include them in the final average:

```sql
SELECT AVG(COALESCE(rating, 0)) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```

To verify that `AVG` was pushed down, look for a `ParadeDB Aggregate Scan` with `average` in the `EXPLAIN` output:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT AVG(rating) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```

```sql Expected Response
                                       QUERY PLAN
