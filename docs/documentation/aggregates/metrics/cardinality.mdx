The cardinality aggregation estimates the number of distinct values in a field.

<CodeGroup dropdown>
```sql
SELECT pdb.agg('{"cardinality": {"field": "rating"}}') FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```

```python Django
from paradedb.functions import Agg
from paradedb.search import All, ParadeDB

MockItem.objects.filter(
    id=ParadeDB(All())
).aggregate(agg=Agg('{"cardinality": {"field": "rating"}}'))
```

</CodeGroup>

```ini Expected Response
      agg
----------------
 {"value": 5.0}
(1 row)
```

Unlike SQL's `DISTINCT` clause, which returns an exact value but is very computationally expensive, the cardinality aggregation uses the HyperLogLog++ algorithm to
closely approximate the number of distinct values.

See the [Tantivy documentation](https://docs.rs/tantivy/latest/tantivy/aggregation/metric/struct.CardinalityAggregationReq.html) for all available options.
