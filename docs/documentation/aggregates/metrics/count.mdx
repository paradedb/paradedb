description: Count the number of values in a field

Use `COUNT(*)` to count the number of matches for a query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```

To exclude null values of a specific field from the final count, pass the field into `COUNT`:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(rating) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```

To verify that `COUNT` was pushed down, look for a `ParadeDB Aggregate Scan` with `value_count` in the `EXPLAIN` output:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT COUNT(rating) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```

```sql Expected Response
