The sum aggregation computes the sum of a field.

```sql
SELECT pdb.agg('{"sum": {"field": "rating"}}') FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```

```ini Expected Response
       agg
------------------
 {"value": 158.0}
(1 row)
```

See the [Tantivy documentation](https://docs.rs/tantivy/latest/tantivy/aggregation/metric/struct.SumAggregation.html) for all available options.

## SQL Sum Syntax

SQL's `SUM` syntax is supported in beta. To enable it, first run

```sql
SET paradedb.enable_aggregate_custom_scan TO on;
```

With this feature enabled, the following query is equivalent to the above and is executed in the same way.

```sql
SELECT SUM(rating) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```

By default, `SUM` ignores null values. Use `COALESCE` to include them in the final sum:

```sql
SELECT SUM(COALESCE(rating, 0)) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```
