`SUM` computes the total over a specific column:

```sql
SELECT SUM(rating) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```

By default, `SUM` ignores null values. Use `COALESCE` to include them in the final sum:

```sql
SELECT SUM(COALESCE(rating, 0)) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```

To verify that `SUM` was pushed down, look for a `ParadeDB Aggregate Scan` with `sum` in the `EXPLAIN` output:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT SUM(rating) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```

```sql Expected Response
