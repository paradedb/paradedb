title: Sum
noindex: true

`SUM` computes the total over a specific column:

```sql
SELECT SUM(rating) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.all();
```

<Note>
  The field being summed, in this case `rating`, must be indexed as
  [fast](/documentation/indexing/fast_fields).
</Note>

By default, `SUM` ignores null values. Use `COALESCE` to include them in the final sum:

```sql
SELECT SUM(COALESCE(rating, 0)) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.all();
```

To verify that `SUM` was pushed down, look for a `ParadeDB Aggregate Scan` with `sum` in the `EXPLAIN` output:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT SUM(rating) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.all();
```
