The `pdb.agg` function accepts an Elasticsearch-compatible JSON aggregate query string. It executes the aggregate using the
[columnar](/welcome/architecture#columnar-index) portion of the ParadeDB index, which can significantly accelerate performance compared to vanilla Postgres.

For example, the following query returns the total number of results for a search query.

```sql
SELECT pdb.agg('{"value_count": {"field": "id"}}')
FROM mock_items
WHERE category === 'electronics';
```

```ini Expected Response
      agg
----------------
 {"value": 5.0}
(1 row)
```

This query counts the number of results for every distinct group:

```sql
SELECT rating, pdb.agg('{"value_count": {"field": "id"}}')
FROM mock_items
WHERE category === 'electronics'
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY rating
LIMIT 5;
```

```ini Expected Response
 rating |      agg
--------+----------------
      3 | {"value": 1.0}
      4 | {"value": 3.0}
      5 | {"value": 1.0}
(3 rows)
```

Please see the [Tantivy documentation](https://docs.rs/tantivy/latest/tantivy/aggregation/index.html)
for details on how to construct these JSON request strings.

## JSON Fields

If `metadata` is a JSON field with key `color`, use `metadata.color` as the field name:

```sql
SELECT pdb.agg('{"terms": {"field": "metadata.color"}}')
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all();
```

## Faceted Queries

A common pattern in search is to query for both an aggregate and a set of search results. For example, "find the top 10
results, and also the count of the total number of results."

Instead of issuing two separate queries -- one for the search results, and another for the aggregate -- `pdb.agg` allows for
these results to be returned in a single "faceted" query. This can significantly improve read throughput, since issuing a single
query decreases CPU usage.

```sql
SELECT
  id, description, rating,
  pdb.agg('{"value_count": {"field": "id"}}') OVER ()
FROM mock_items
WHERE category === 'electronics'
ORDER BY rating DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

```ini Expected Response
 id |         description         | rating |      agg
----+-----------------------------+--------+----------------
 12 | Innovative wireless earbuds |      5 | {"value": 5.0}
  1 | Ergonomic metal keyboard    |      4 | {"value": 5.0}
  2 | Plastic Keyboard            |      4 | {"value": 5.0}
(3 rows)
```

Note how this query returned the top 3 results, in addition to the total number of results found.
