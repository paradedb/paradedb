Full text search is a technique that finds all relevant entries in a collection of documents based on the presence of keywords and phrases.
The algorithm used by ParadeDBâ€™s full text search, BM25, is widely used by modern search engines.

For each matching document, BM25 calculates a relevance score based on factors like term frequency in the document, inverse document frequency of the term across all documents, and the length of the document.
