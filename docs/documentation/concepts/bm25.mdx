Full text search is a technique that finds all relevant entries in a collection of documents based on the presence of keywords and phrases.
The algorithm used by ParadeDB’s full text search, BM25, is widely used by modern search engines.

For each matching document, BM25 calculates a relevance score based on factors like term frequency in the document, inverse document frequency of the term across all documents, and the length of the document.
