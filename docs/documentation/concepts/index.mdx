## Overview

In Postgres, an index is a database structure that enhances the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. By creating an index on one or more columns, Postgres can quickly locate and access the required data without scanning every row in the table.
Proper use of indexes can significantly improve query performance, but it's important to use them judiciously, as they can add overhead to write operations like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

## Inverted Index

An inverted index is a fundamental data structure used in full text search to enable efficient retrieval of documents
containing specific terms. Unlike a traditional index that maps documents to the terms they contain, an inverted index flips
this relationship by mapping each term to the list of documents where it appears. The construction of an inverted index involves
tokenizing the text and then creating a lookup table that associates these terms with their corresponding document identifiers.
When a search query is executed, the inverted index is used to quickly retrieve all documents that match the search terms.

## BM25 Index

The BM25 index is the name given to the inverted index that enables ParadeDB to perform full text search over a
Postgres table. This index is strongly consistent, which means that new data is immediately searchable across all connections.
Once this index is created, it automatically stays in sync with the underlying table as the data changes.
