title: Configuration
---

ParadeDB exposes a few Grand Unified Configuration (GUC) parameters that be turned
on or off.

## Custom Scans

ParadeDB uses [custom scans](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/custom-scan.html)
to optimize query execution. By default, custom scans are enabled.

```sql
SET paradedb.enable_custom_scan = true;
```

Custom scans should only be disabled for debugging purposes. They must be enabled for scoring, highlighting,
and various predicate pushdowns to work.

## Telemetry

By default, ParadeDB collects anonymous telemetry to better understand how many people are
using the open source project. This can be disabled with:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET paradedb.pg_search_telemetry TO 'off';
```
