title: Custom Scans
---

ParadeDB uses [custom scans](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/custom-scan.html)
to optimize query execution. By default, custom scans are enabled.

```sql
SET paradedb.enable_custom_scan = true;
```

Custom scans should only be disabled for debugging purposes. They must be enabled for scoring, highlighting,
and various predicate pushdowns to work.
