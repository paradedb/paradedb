### Maintenance Working Memory

The default Postgres `maintenance_work_mem` value of `64MB` is quite conservative and can slow down parallel index builds. We recommend at least `64MB` per
[parallel worker](/documentation/configuration/index#parallel-indexing-workers).

```bash postgresql.conf
maintenance_work_mem = 16GB
```

Each worker is required to have at least `15MB` memory. If `maintenance_work_mem` is set too low, an error will be returned.

### Parallel Indexing Workers

ParadeDB uses Postgres' `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` setting to determine the degree of parallelism during `CREATE INDEX`/`REINDEX`. Postgres' default is `2`, which may be too low for large tables.

```sql
SET max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 8;
```

In order for `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` to take effect, it must be less than or equal to both `max_parallel_workers` and `max_worker_processes`.
