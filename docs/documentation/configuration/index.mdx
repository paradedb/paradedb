title: Index Build

### Maintenance Working Memory

The default Postgres `maintenance_work_mem` value of `64MB` is quite conservative and can significantly slow down index builds. For large indexes,
we strongly recommend increasing `maintenance_work_mem`.

```bash postgresql.conf
maintenance_work_mem = 16GB
```

`maintenance_work_mem` should not exceed the server's available memory.

### Parallel Indexing Processes

ParadeDB uses Postgres' `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` setting to determine the degree of parallelism during `CREATE INDEX`/`REINDEX`. Postgres' default is `2`, which may be too low for large tables.
Consider using a value closer to the number of CPU threads on the host computer.

```sql
SET max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 8;
```

In order for `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` to take effect, it must be less than or equal to both `max_parallel_workers` and `max_worker_processes`.

### Target Segment Count

By default, `CREATE INDEX`/`REINDEX` will create as many segments as there are CPUs on the host machine. This can be changed with
`paradedb.target_segment_count`.

For optimal performance, the segment count should equal the number of parallel workers that a query can receive, which is controlled by
[`max_parallel_workers_per_gather`](/documentation/configuration/parallel#parallel-workers). If `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` is greater than the number of CPUs on the host machine, then increasing the target segment count to match `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` can improve query
performance.

```sql
SET paradedb.target_segment_count = 32;
```

### Choosing the Right Settings

More workers and more memory per worker will generally improve `CREATE INDEX` speeds. As a general rule of thumb, `maintenance_work_mem` can be set as high as
25% of total memory (to make room for other processes) and `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` can be set as high as the number of CPUs on the host machine.

During indexing, each worker is assigned an amount of memory approximately equal to `maintenance_work_mem / max_parallel_maintenance_workers`. This means that if you want
`8` workers, each with `1GB` of memory, then `maintenance_work_mem` should be set to `8GB`.

Each worker is required to have at least `64MB` memory. If `maintenance_work_mem` is set too low, it will be ignored and `64MB * max_parallel_maintenance_workers` will be used.
