title: Index Build

### Maintenance Working Memory

The default Postgres `maintenance_work_mem` value of `64MB` is quite conservative and can significantly slow down index builds. For large indexes,
we strongly recommend increasing `maintenance_work_mem`.

```bash postgresql.conf
maintenance_work_mem = 16GB
```

`maintenance_work_mem` should not exceed the server's available memory.

### Indexing Memory per Thread

<Note>This setting requires superuser privileges.</Note>

`paradedb.create_index_memory_budget` defaults to `1024MB`. It sets the amount of memory to dedicate per indexing thread before the index segment needs to be
written to disk. The value is measured in megabytes. In terms of raw indexing performance, larger is generally better.

If set to `0`, `maintenance_work_mem` divided by [indexing parallelism](#indexing-threads) will be used.

```sql
SET paradedb.create_index_memory_budget = 2048;
```

In addition to improving build times, this setting also affects the number of segments created in the index. This is because, while ParadeDB tries to maintain as many segments as CPUs, a segment that cannot fit into memory will be split into a new segment. As a result, an insufficient `paradedb.create_index_memory_budget` can lead to significantly more segments than available CPUs, which degrades search performance. To check if the chosen value value is high enough, you can compare the index’s segment count with the server’s CPU count.

### Indexing Progress

ParadeDB can write indexing progress to the Postgres logs, which helps monitor the progress of a long-running `CREATE INDEX` statement.

First, Postgres logs must be enabled in `postgresql.conf` and Postgres must be restarted afterward.

```ini postgresql.conf
logging_collector = on
```

Next, set `paradedb.log_create_index_progress` to `true`. This creates Postgres `LOG:` entries every `100,000` rows with information on the indexing rate (in rows per second).

```sql
SET paradedb.log_create_index_progress = true;
```

The logs will appear in the directory specified in `log_directory`.

```sql
SHOW log_directory;
```

### Indexing Threads

<Note>This setting requires superuser privileges.</Note>

`paradedb.create_index_parallelism` sets the number of threads used during `CREATE INDEX`. The default is `0`, which
automatically detects the "available parallelism" of the host computer.

```sql
SET paradedb.create_index_parallelism = 8;
```
