title: Index Size
---

There are a few things you can do to optimize the BM25 [index size](/documentation/indexing/inspect_index#index-size).

## Index Creation

If possible, creating the BM25 index should be deferred until **after** a table has been populated. To illustrate:

```sql
-- This is preferred
CREATE TABLE test (id SERIAL, data text);
INSERT INTO test (data) VALUES ('hello world'), ('many more values');
CREATE INDEX ON test USING bm25 (id, data) WITH (key_field = 'id');

-- ...to this
CREATE TABLE test (id SERIAL, data text);
CREATE INDEX ON test USING bm25 (id, data) WITH (key_field = 'id');
INSERT INTO test (data) VALUES ('hello world'), ('many more values');
```

This allows the BM25 index to create a more tightly packed, efficient representation on disk.

## Vacuuming

When rows are updated/deleted or [segments](/documentation/concepts/index#segment) are merged together, parts of the index can be rendered "dead."
`VACUUM`s, which can either be run manually or automatically by Postgres [autovacuum](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-autovacuum.html),
are responsible for marking the space occupied by dead segments as "free for reuse" by future `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`COPY` statements.

A `DELETE` statement does **not** create free space on its own. To control the index size, it is important to either:

1. Tune autovacuum in `postgresql.conf` such that vacuums occur at a frequency that is acceptable for your write patterns. Please refer to the [Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-autovacuum.html) for guidance.
2. Manually run `VACUUM` between large `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/`COPY` statements.

If the index has already grown too large as a result of failure to vacuum, the only way to shrink the index size is to drop the index or `REINDEX`. Vacuums on their own do **not** decrease the
index size â€” they only mark space for reuse.
