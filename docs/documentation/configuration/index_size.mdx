## Index Creation

If possible, we recommend deferring BM25 index creation until **after** a table has been populated. For instance:

```sql
-- This is preferred
CREATE TABLE test (id SERIAL, data text);
INSERT INTO test (data) VALUES ('hello world'), ('many more values');
CREATE INDEX ON test USING bm25 (id, data) WITH (key_field = 'id');

-- ...to this
CREATE TABLE test (id SERIAL, data text);
CREATE INDEX ON test USING bm25 (id, data) WITH (key_field = 'id');
INSERT INTO test (data) VALUES ('hello world'), ('many more values');
```

Creating the BM25 index on a pre-populated table leads to a more tightly packed, efficient representation on disk.

## Inserts and Updates

Every `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statement creates at least one new [segment](/documentation/concepts/index#segment). When deciding where to write the new segment,
ParadeDB first attempts to re-use space occupied by dead segments. If there's not enough free space, ParadeDB will extend the index, which increases its size on disk.

Free space is created by a `VACUUM`, which can either be run manually or automatically by Postgres [autovacuum](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-autovacuum.html).
