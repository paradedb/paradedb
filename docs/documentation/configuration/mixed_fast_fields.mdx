## Mixed Fast Fields Execution

The Mixed Fast Fields execution state (`MixedFastFieldExecState`) is a specialized execution method for
handling multiple string and numeric fast fields in a single query. By default, Mixed Fast Fields
execution is enabled when there are a mix of column types, and fewer than a threshold of columns
requested.

To disable Mixed:

```sql
SET paradedb.enable_mixed_fast_field_exec = false;
```

### When to Use

Mixed Fast Fields execution can provide performance benefits in queries that:

1. Use multiple string fast fields in a single query
2. Use a combination of string and numeric fast fields in a single query

This is particularly useful in complex join queries where multiple fast fields need to be accessed efficiently.

### Trade-offs

Mixed Fast Fields fetches data as column-oriented, whereas the Normal mode fetches data as
row-oriented. The default threshold for switching to Normal is three columns, but with a wide enough
row, allowing Mixed to be used for more columns might be reasonable.

To adjust the column count threshold at which Normal execution will be used instead (default 3):

```sql
SET paradedb.mixed_fast_field_exec_column_threshold = 4;
```
