title: Overview

To give database administrators fine-grained control over resource consumption, the BM25 index only uses as much memory and CPUs as allowed by the index's settings. Several of these settings
match Postgres' `postgresql.conf` settings, which are quite conservative by default. Adjusting these settings allows ParadeDB to take advantage of the server's hardware and is
strongly recommended.

## Types of Settings

The BM25 index's settings fall into one of two categories: Postgres settings and ParadeDB-specific settings.

### Postgres Settings

A Postgres setting can be found in the `postgresql.conf` file, which can be located with `SHOW`.

```sql
SHOW config_file;
```

These settings can be changed in two ways:

1. By editing the `postgresql.conf` file and restarting Postgres. This makes the setting permanent for all sessions.
2. By running `SET`. This temporarily changes the setting for the current session. Note that Postgres does not allow all `postgresql.conf` settings to be changed with `SET`.

### ParadeDB Settings

A ParadeDB setting begins with `paradedb.` and applies only to the current session. For instance:

```sql
SET paradedb.log_create_index_progress = true;
```
