ParadeDB uses Postgres' settings, which can be found in the `postgresql.conf` file. To find your `postgresql.conf` file, use `SHOW`.

```sql
SHOW config_file;
```

These settings can be changed in several ways:

1. By editing the `postgresql.conf` file and restarting Postgres. This makes the setting permanent for all sessions.
2. By running `SET`. This temporarily changes the setting for the current session. Note that Postgres does not allow all `postgresql.conf` settings to be changed with `SET`.

```sql
SET maintenance_work_mem = '8GB'
```
