title: Segment Size
---

During every `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`COPY` statement, the BM25 index will look for opportunities to merge [segments](/documentation/concepts/index#segment) together.
This is done to optimize search performance by reducing the number of segments that need to be scanned.

The segment merge policy is a configurable policy that attempts to merge segments into layers of different sizes.

## Segment Layer Size

After an `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`COPY` statement, the BM25 index will attempt to merge segments into layers of size `100KB`, `1MB`, `10MB`, `100GB`, `1TB`, and `10TB`. This means
that, if there are ten segments each `10KB` each in size, they will be merged into a single segment that is `100KB`. However,
if there are only eight segments that are `10KB` each, they will not be merged together because they are not enough to meet the size
of the next layer.

The default segment layer sizes can be changed at index creation time or afterward:

```sql
CREATE INDEX search_idx ON mock_items USING bm25 (id, description, rating) WITH (key_field = 'id', layer_sizes = '1kb, 10kb, 100MB');
ALTER INDEX search_idx SET (layer_sizes = '100kb, 1mb, 100mb');
```

To view the current layer sizes, use `paradedb.layer_sizes`. This function returns the size of each layer in bytes.

```sql
SELECT paradedb.layer_sizes('search_idx');
```

## Background Merge Threshold

Merging can either happen in the foreground, as part of the `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`COPY` statement, or asynchronously in the background. As a general
rule of thumb, merging larger layers is expensive and should happen in the background, whereas merging smaller layers is cheap and should happen in the foregorund
to reduces the overhead of creating many background processes.

`background_layer_size_threshold` controls which layers should be merged in the foreground as part of the `INSERT`/`UPDATE` statement
versus asychronously in the background. The default is `10MB`, which means layers of size `10MB` and greater are merged in the background.

```sql
CREATE INDEX search_idx ON mock_items USING bm25 (id, description, rating) WITH (key_field = 'id', background_layer_size_threshold = '100MB');
ALTER INDEX search_idx SET (background_layer_size_threshold = '100MB');
```

Setting `background_layer_size_threshold` to `0` disables background merging and forces all merging to happen in the foreground.
