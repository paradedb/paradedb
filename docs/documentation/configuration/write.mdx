title: Write Throughput
---

Several settings can be used to tune the throughput of `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`COPY` statements to the BM25 index.

## Work Memory

`work_mem` controls how much memory to allocate to a single `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`COPY` statement. Each statement that writes to a BM25 index is required to have at least `15MB` memory. If
`work_mem` is below `15MB`, it will be ignored and `15MB` will be used.

If your typical update patterns are single-row atomic `INSERT`s or `UPDATE`s, then a value of `15MB` can prevent unnecessary memory from being allocated. For bulk inserts
and updates, a larger value is better.

```sql
SET work_mem = 15MB;
```

Since many write operations can be running concurrently, this value should be raised more conservatively than `maintenance_work_mem`.
