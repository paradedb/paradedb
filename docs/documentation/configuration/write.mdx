title: Throughput
---

Several settings can be used to tune the throughput of `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`COPY` statements to the BM25 index.

## Statement Parallelism

`paradedb.statement_parallelism` controls the number of indexing threads used during `INSERT/UPDATE/COPY`. The default is `1` which will generally ensure only one
segment is created by the INSERT/UPDATE/COPY statement.

A value of zero will detect the "available parallelism" of the host computer.

If your typical update patterns are single/few-row atomic `INSERT`s or `UPDATE`s, then a value of `1` can prevent extra segments from being created that later must be merged.
For bulk inserts and updates, a larger value is better.

```sql
SET paradedb.statement_parallelism = 1;
```

## Statement Memory Budget

`paradedb.statement_memory_budget` defaults to `1024MB`. It sets the amount of memory to dedicate per indexing thread before the index segment needs to be
written to disk. The value is measured in megabytes. In terms of raw indexing performance, larger is generally better.

If set to `0`, `maintenance_work_mem` divided by [statement parallelism](#statement-parallelism) will be used.

If your typical update patterns are single-row atomic `INSERT`s or `UPDATE`s, then a value of `15MB` can prevent unnecessary memory from being allocated. For bulk inserts
and updates, a larger value is better.

```sql
SET paradedb.statement_memory_budget = 15;
```

Like [`paradedb.create_index_memory_budget`](/documentation/configuration/index#indexing-memory-per-thread), this setting can affect the number of segments in the index.

## Max Mergeable Segment Size

`paradedb.max_mergeable_segment_size` sets an upper limit on a segment's (estimated) byte size, measured in bytes, above which the segment will no longer be considered
for merging.

While it is beneficial, at query time, for an index to have roughly the same number of segments as CPUs of the host computer, it can be detrimental to write performance
to merge large segments, either with each other or with a smaller segment.

This parameter defaults to 200MB and should be adjusted up or down to find a balance between total index segment count and host CPUs in such a manner that acceptable
write and search performance is achieved.

```sql
SET paradedb.max_mergeable_segment_size = 200MB;
```

## Segment Merge Scale Factor

`paradedb.segment_merge_scale_factor` is an integer, defaulting to `1` (one), that can be used to defer merging segments util the index has at least `"available parallelism" * paradedb.segment_merge_scale_factor + 1` segments.

This can be helpful for ensuring newly-created small segments aren't always merged together with existing larger segments, but rather merged together at some future point.segment_merge_scale_factor

Determining the proper value will depend on the number of rows typical INSERT/UPDATE statements create along with how having more segments impacts search performance.

```sql
SET paradedb.segment_merge_scale_factor = 1;
```
