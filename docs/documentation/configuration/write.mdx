title: Throughput
---

Several settings can be used to tune the throughput of `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`COPY` statements to the BM25 index.

## Statement Parallelism

<Note>This setting requires superuser privileges.</Note>

`paradedb.statement_parallelism` controls the number of indexing threads used during `INSERT/UPDATE/COPY`. The default is `0`, which automatically detects the
"available parallelism" of the host computer.

If your typical update patterns are single-row atomic `INSERT`s or `UPDATE`s, then a value of `1` can prevent unnecessary threads from being spun up. For bulk inserts
and updates, a larger value is better.

```sql
SET paradedb.statement_parallelism = 1;
```

## Statement Memory Budget

<Note>This setting requires superuser privileges.</Note>

`paradedb.statement_memory_budget` defaults to `1024MB`. It sets the amount of memory to dedicate per indexing thread before the index segment needs to be
written to disk. The value is measured in megabytes. In terms of raw indexing performance, larger is generally better.

If set to `0`, `maintenance_work_mem` divided by [statement parallelism](#statement-parallelism) will be used.

If your typical update patterns are single-row atomic `INSERT`s or `UPDATE`s, then a value of `15MB` can prevent unnecessary memory from being allocated. For bulk inserts
and updates, a larger value is better.

```sql
SET paradedb.statement_memory_budget = 15;
```

Like [`paradedb.create_index_memory_budget`](/documentation/configuration/index#indexing-memory-per-thread), this setting can affect the number of segments in the index.
