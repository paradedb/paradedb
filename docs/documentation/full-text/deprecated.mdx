title: Deprecated Syntax
---

The `<column name> @@@ '<query string>'` syntax is being deprecated. We recommend migrating to the [new syntax](/documentation/full-text/overview),
but have preserved documentation for the deprecated syntax for existing users.

## Basic Usage

Applies a query string against a specified field.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes';
```

If the provided query string can be tokenized further, the tokenization is automatically applied at search time using the field's index-time tokenizer.

### Multiple Terms

`AND` and `OR` can be used to combine and filter multiple terms.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'keyboard' OR category @@@ 'toy';
```

If multiple terms are passed into the same query string, they are `OR`ed together by default.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'keyboard headphones';
```

### Not Term

`-` omits results that contain a specific term. The following query finds documents that match
`shoes` or `running` but not `white`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '(shoes running -white)';
```

<Note>
  To enable phrase search, a field must be indexed with
  [record](/documentation/indexing/record) of `position`.
</Note>

## Phrase Search

Searches for a specific [phrase](/documentation/concepts/phrase). Phrases must be wrapped inside
double quotes. The following query finds all documents with the word `plastic` followed immediately by `keyboard`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '"plastic keyboard"';
```

### Slop Operator

The `~` slop operator allows for other words to come in between words in the query phrase. For instance, the following query finds documents containing
the word `ergonomic` followed by `keyboard`, allowing for a maximum of one word in between.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '"ergonomic keyboard"~1';
```

### Phrase Prefix

The `*` prefix operator allows for the last term in the phrase query to be the prefix of another word. For instance,
`"plastic keyb"*` matches `plastic keyboard`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '"plastic keyb"*';
```

## Boosting

The `^` operator is used to boost the scores of individual fields by a constant. In the following query, `description` is weighted twice as heavily as `category` in the final BM25 score.

```sql
SELECT id, paradedb.score(id)
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes^2' OR category @@@ 'footwear'
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Special Characters

The special characters `+` , `^`, `` ` ``, `:`, `{`, `}`, `"`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `<`, `>`,`~`, `!`, `\\`, `\*`, and `SPACE` must
be escaped by a `\` inside the query term.
