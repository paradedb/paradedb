title: Highlighting
---

<Note>
Highlighting is an expensive process and can slow down query times.
We recommend passing a `LIMIT` to any query where `paradedb.snippet` is called to restrict the
number of snippets that need to be generated.
</Note>

<Note>
Highlighting is not supported for `paradedb.fuzzy_term` and `paradedb.fuzzy_phrase`.
</Note>

Highlighting refers to the practice of visually emphasizing the portions of a document that match a user's
search query. Highlighted snippets of text are by default wrapped in `<b></b>` tags. This can
be modified with the `start_tag` and `end_tag` arguments.

## Basic Usage

`paradedb.snippet(<column>)` can be added to any query where an `@@@` operator is present.
The following query generates highlighted snippets against the `description` field.

```sql
SELECT id, paradedb.snippet(description)
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes'
LIMIT 5;
```

<ParamField body="start_tag" default="<b>">
  The leading indicator around the highlighted region.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="end_tag" default="</b>">
  The trailing indicator around the highlighted region.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="max_num_chars" default={150}>
  Max number of characters for a highlighted fragment.
</ParamField>

By default, `<b></b>` encloses the snippet. This can be configured with `start_tag` and `end_tag`:

```sql
SELECT id, paradedb.snippet(description, start_tag => '<i>', end_tag => '</i>')
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes'
LIMIT 5;
```
