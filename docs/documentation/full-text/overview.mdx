<Note>
  **Prerequisite** Before performing full text search over a table, ensure that
  it has been [indexed](/documentation/indexing/create_index) and properly
  [tuned](/documentation/configuration).
</Note>

## Basic Usage

`@@@` is ParadeDB's full text search operator that means "find all rows matching a full text query." The left-hand side of `@@@` accepts the [key field](/documentation/indexing/create_index#choosing-a-key-field), and the right-hand side accepts
a query string.

For example, the following query returns all rows where the `description` field matches the query `shoes`.

```sql Function Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes';
```

Under the hood, the query string is tokenized with the same tokenizer that the field used at index creation time.

### Multiple Terms

`AND` and `OR` can be used to combine and filter multiple terms.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'keyboard' OR category @@@ 'toy';
```

If multiple terms are passed into the same query string, they are `OR`ed together by default.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'keyboard headphones';
```

### Not Term

`-` omits results that contain a specific term. The following query finds documents that match
`shoes` or `running` but not `white`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '(shoes running -white)';
```

<Note>
  To enable phrase search, a field must be indexed with
  [record](/documentation/indexing/record) of `position`.
</Note>

## Phrase Search

Searches for a specific [phrase](/documentation/concepts/phrase). Phrases must be wrapped inside
double quotes. The following query finds all documents with the word `plastic` followed immediately by `keyboard`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '"plastic keyboard"';
```

### Slop Operator

The `~` slop operator allows for other words to come in between words in the query phrase. For instance, the following query finds documents containing
the word `ergonomic` followed by `keyboard`, allowing for a maximum of one word in between.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '"ergonomic keyboard"~1';
```

### Phrase Prefix

The `*` prefix operator allows for the last term in the phrase query to be the prefix of another word. For instance,
`"plastic keyb"*` matches `plastic keyboard`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '"plastic keyb"*';
```

## Special Characters

The special characters `+` , `^`, `` ` ``, `:`, `{`, `}`, `"`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `<`, `>`,`~`, `!`, `\\`, `\*`, and `SPACE` must
be escaped by a `\` inside the query term.
