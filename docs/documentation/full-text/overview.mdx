<Note>
  **Prerequisite** Before performing full text search over a table, ensure that
  it has been [indexed](/documentation/indexing/create_index) and properly
  [tuned](/documentation/configuration).
</Note>

## Basic Usage

`@@@` is ParadeDB's full text search operator that means "find all rows matching a full text query." The left-hand side of `@@@` accepts the [key field](/documentation/indexing/create_index#choosing-a-key-field), and the right-hand side accepts
either a [query builder function](/documentation/advanced/overview#query-builder-functions) or a [JSON object](documentation/advanced/overview#basic-usage).

For example, the following query returns all rows where the `description` field matches the query `shoes`.

<CodeGroup>

```sql Function Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.match('description', 'shoes');
```

```sql JSON Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@
'{
    "match": {
        "field": "description",
        "value": "shoes"
    }
}'::jsonb;
```

</CodeGroup>

If you are familiar with Elasticsearch's API, you may notice that ParadeDB's query functions are similar to
Elastic's query DSL. This is intentional â€” ParadeDB uses the same terminology as Elasticsearch for its query types.
For example, [`paradedb.match`]() is analogous to Elastic's match query.

In addition to `paradedb.match`, there are over a dozen other [query types](/documentation/advanced).
