<Note>
  **Prerequisite** Before performing full text search over a table, it must
  first be [indexed](/documentation/indexing/create_index).
</Note>

## Basic Usage

`@@@` is ParadeDB's full text search operator that means "find all rows matching a full text query." The left-hand side of `@@@` accepts the field to search against, and the right-hand side accepts the query string.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes'
LIMIT 5;
```

`@@@` itself **does not** perform any ordering, offsets, limits, or scoring. These operations need to be added to the overall query with `ORDER BY`, `OFFSET`, `LIMIT`, and [`paradedb.score`](/documentation/full-text/scoring).

## Query Language

The query string on the right-hand side of `@@@` uses a mini query language that supports [term](/documentation/full-text/term),
[phrase](/documentation/full-text/phrase), [filtered](/documentation/full-text/filtering), and [boosted](/documentation/full-text/boosting) queries.
It also accepts [query builder functions](/documentation/advanced) for advanced, "Elastic DSL" style queries.

## Performance Tuning

The BM25 index is designed to take advantage of Postgres parallel workers for optimized query performance. For
large tables, increasing the default [parallel worker count](/documentation/configuration/parallel) is encouraged.
