title: Phrase Search
---

<Note>
  To enable phrase search, a field must be indexed with
  [record](/documentation/indexing/record) of `position`.
</Note>

## Basic Usage

Searches for a specific [phrase](/documentation/concepts/phrase). Phrases must be wrapped inside
double quotes. The following query finds all documents with the word `plastic` followed immediately by `keyboard`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '"plastic keyboard"';
```

## Slop Operator

The `~` slop operator allows for other words to come in between words in the query phrase. For instance, the following query finds documents containing
the word `ergonomic` followed by `keyboard`, allowing for a maximum of one word in between.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '"ergonomic keyboard"~1';
```

## Phrase Prefix

The `*` prefix operator allows for the last term in the phrase query to be the prefix of another word. For instance,
`"plastic keyb"*` matches `plastic keyboard`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '"plastic keyb"*';
```

## Special Characters

The special characters `+` , `^`, `` ` ``, `:`, `{`, `}`, `"`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `<`, `>`, `~`, `!`, `\\`, and `\*` must be
escaped by a `\` inside the query term.
