title: Phrase

Searches for the presence of a [phrase](/documentation/concepts/phrase). The field must be indexed with [record](/documentation/indexing/record) of `position`.
For more granular controls, see the [phrase query](/documentation/advanced/phrase).

## Basic Usage

Phrases must be wrapped inside double quotes. The following query finds all documents with the word `plastic` followed immediately by `keyboard`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '"plastic keyboard"';
```

Under the hood, the query string is first tokenized in the same way as the field was at index time. Then, a phrase query is executed with the tokenized
values.

## Slop Operator

The `~` slop operator allows for other words to come in between words in the query phrase. For instance, the following query finds documents containing
the word `ergonomic` followed by `keyboard`, allowing for a maximum of one word in between.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '"ergonomic keyboard"~1';
```

## Phrase Prefix

The `*` prefix operator allows for the last term in the phrase query to be the prefix of another word. For instance,
`"plastic keyb"*` matches `plastic keyboard`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '"plastic keyb"*';
```
