Term queries look for exact token matches.

Unlike [match](/documentation/full-text/match) or [phrase](/documentation/full-text/phrase) queries, term queries treat the query
string as a finalized token. This means that the query string is taken as-is, without any further tokenization or processing,
regardless of how the target column is tokenized.

To understand exactly how this works, let's consider the following term query:

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description === 'running';
```

This query returns:

```csv
     description     | rating | category
---------------------+--------+----------
 Sleek running shoes |      5 | Footwear
(1 row)
```

Under the hood, here's what `===` does:

1. Retrieves the [tokenizer configuration](/documentation/indexing/tokenizers) of the `description` column. In this example,
   let's assume `description` uses the [default](/documentation/indexing/tokenizers#default) tokenizer, which splits on whitespace
   and punctuation.
2. Finds all rows where `description` contains the exact token, `running`.

When using the term query, it's important to remember that a result will only be considered a match if one of its tokens is a match.
For instance, consider the following query:

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description === 'running shoes';
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
  ```csv description | rating | category -------------+--------+---------- (0
  rows) ```
</Accordion>

This query will **not** match the document `Sleek running shoes` because its tokens are `sleek`, `running`, and `shoes`, not
`running shoes`.

## Case Sensitivity

Because term queries look for exact token matches, they are case sensitive. This means that the following two queries
are **not** equivalent:

```sql
-- Looks for the token `running`
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description === 'running';

-- Looks for the token `RUNNING`
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description === 'RUNNING';
```
