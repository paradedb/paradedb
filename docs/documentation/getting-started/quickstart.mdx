This guide will walk you through a few queries to give you a feel for ParadeDB.

## Create Example Table

ParadeDB comes with a helpful procedure that creates a table populated with mock data to help
you get started. Once connected with `psql`, run the following commands to create and inspect
this table.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25_test_table(
  schema_name => 'public',
  table_name => 'mock_items'
);

SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
       description        | rating |  category
--------------------------+--------+-------------
 Ergonomic metal keyboard |      4 | Electronics
 Plastic Keyboard         |      4 | Electronics
 Sleek running shoes      |      5 | Footwear
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

Next, let's create a BM25 index called `search_idx` on this table. A BM25 index is a covering index, which means that multiple columns can be included in the same index.

```sql
CREATE INDEX search_idx ON mock_items
USING bm25 (id, description, category, rating, in_stock, created_at, metadata, weight_range)
WITH (key_field='id');
```

<Note>
As a general rule of thumb, any columns that you want to filter, `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, or `ORDER BY` as part of a full text query should be added to the index for faster
performance.
</Note>

<Note>
  Note the mandatory `key_field` option. Every BM25 index needs a `key_field`,
  which should be the name of a column that will function as a row's unique
  identifier within the index. Additionally, the `key_field` must be the first field
  in the list of columns. See [choosing a key field](/documentation/indexing/create_index#choosing-a-key-field) for more details.
</Note>

## Match Query

We're now ready to execute a basic text search query. We'll look for matches where `description` matches `running shoes` where `rating` is greater than `2`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description ||| 'running shoes' AND rating > 2
ORDER BY rating
LIMIT 5;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
     description     | rating | category
---------------------+--------+----------
 White jogging shoes |      3 | Footwear
 Generic shoes       |      4 | Footwear
 Sleek running shoes |      5 | Footwear
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

`|||` is ParadeDB's custom [match disjunction](/documentation/full-text/match#disjunction) operator, which means "find me all documents containing
`running OR shoes`.

If we want all documents containing `running AND shoes`, we can use ParadeDB's `&&&` [match conjunction](/documentation/full-text/match#conjunction) operator.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description &&& 'running shoes' AND rating > 2
ORDER BY rating
LIMIT 5;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
     description     | rating | category
---------------------+--------+----------
 Sleek running shoes |      5 | Footwear
(1 row)
```
</Accordion>

## BM25 Scoring

Next, let's add BM25 scoring to the results, which allows us to sort matches by relevance. To do this, we'll use `paradedb.score`.

```sql
SELECT description, paradedb.score(id)
FROM mock_items
WHERE description ||| 'running shoes' AND rating > 2
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
     description     |   score
---------------------+-----------
 Sleek running shoes |  6.833782
 Generic shoes       |  3.901802
 White jogging shoes | 3.4987166
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

## Highlighting

Finally, let's also [highlight](/documentation/full-text/highlight) the relevant portions of the documents that were matched.
To do this, we'll use `paradedb.snippet`.


```sql
SELECT description, paradedb.snippet(description), paradedb.score(id)
FROM mock_items
WHERE description ||| 'running shoes' AND rating > 2
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
     description     |              snippet              |   score
---------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------
 Sleek running shoes | Sleek <b>running</b> <b>shoes</b> |  6.833782
 Generic shoes       | Generic <b>shoes</b>              |  3.901802
 White jogging shoes | White jogging <b>shoes</b>        | 3.4987166
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

## Joined Search

ParadeDB supports full text search over JOINs, which is crucial for database schemas that store data in a normalized fashion. To demonstrate, let's create a table
called `orders` that references `mock_items`.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25_test_table(
  schema_name => 'public',
  table_name => 'orders',
  table_type => 'Orders'
);

ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT foreign_key_product_id
FOREIGN KEY (product_id)
REFERENCES mock_items(id);

SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
 order_id | product_id | order_quantity | order_total | customer_name
----------+------------+----------------+-------------+---------------
        1 |          1 |              3 |       99.99 | John Doe
        2 |          2 |              1 |       49.99 | Jane Smith
        3 |          3 |              5 |      249.95 | Alice Johnson
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

Next, let's create a [BM25 index](/welcome/roadmap/architecture#) over the `orders` table.

```sql
CREATE INDEX orders_idx ON orders
USING bm25 (order_id, customer_name)
WITH (key_field='order_id');
```

The following query searches for rows where `customer_name` matches `Johnson` and `description` matches `shoes`.

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, o.customer_name, m.description
FROM orders o
JOIN mock_items m ON o.product_id = m.id
WHERE o.customer_name ||| 'Johnson' AND m.description ||| 'shoes'
ORDER BY order_id
LIMIT 5;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
 order_id | customer_name |     description
----------+---------------+---------------------
        3 | Alice Johnson | Sleek running shoes
        6 | Alice Johnson | White jogging shoes
       36 | Alice Johnson | White jogging shoes
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

## Similarity Search

For vector similarity search, let's first generate a vector embeddings column. For the sake of this tutorial, we'll
randomly generate these embeddings.

```sql
ALTER TABLE mock_items ADD COLUMN embedding vector(3);

UPDATE mock_items m
SET embedding = ('[' ||
    ((m.id + 1) % 10 + 1)::integer || ',' ||
    ((m.id + 2) % 10 + 1)::integer || ',' ||
    ((m.id + 3) % 10 + 1)::integer || ']')::vector;

SELECT description, rating, category, embedding
FROM mock_items
LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
       description        | rating |  category   | embedding
--------------------------+--------+-------------+-----------
 Ergonomic metal keyboard |      4 | Electronics | [3,4,5]
 Plastic Keyboard         |      4 | Electronics | [4,5,6]
 Sleek running shoes      |      5 | Footwear    | [5,6,7]
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

Next, let's create an HNSW index on the `embedding` column of our table.
While not required, an HNSW index can drastically improve query performance over very large datasets.

```sql
CREATE INDEX on mock_items
USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

Next, let's query our table with a vector and order the results by cosine distance:

```sql
SELECT description, category, rating, embedding
FROM mock_items
ORDER BY embedding <=> '[1,2,3]', description
LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
       description        |  category  | rating | embedding
--------------------------+------------+--------+-----------
 Artistic ceramic vase    | Home Decor |      4 | [1,2,3]
 Designer wall paintings  | Home Decor |      5 | [1,2,3]
 Handcrafted wooden frame | Home Decor |      5 | [1,2,3]
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

That's it! Next, let's [load your data](/documentation/getting-started/load) to start running real queries.
