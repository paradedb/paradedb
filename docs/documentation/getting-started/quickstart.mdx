This guide will walk you through the following steps to get started with ParadeDB:

1. Full text search over a single table
2. Full text search over a JOIN
3. Similarity (i.e. vector) search

## Single Table Search

ParadeDB comes with a helpful procedure that creates a table populated with mock data to help
you get started. Once connected with `psql`, run the following commands to create and inspect
this table.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25_test_table(
  schema_name => 'public',
  table_name => 'mock_items'
);

SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
       description        | rating |  category
--------------------------+--------+-------------
 Ergonomic metal keyboard |      4 | Electronics
 Plastic Keyboard         |      4 | Electronics
 Sleek running shoes      |      5 | Footwear
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

Next, let's create a BM25 index called `search_idx` on this table. A BM25 index is a covering index, which means that multiple columns can be included in the same index.
The following code block demonstrates the various Postgres types that can be combined inside a single index.

```sql
CREATE INDEX search_idx ON mock_items
USING bm25 (id, description, category, rating, in_stock, created_at, metadata, weight_range)
WITH (key_field='id');
```

<Note>
  Note the mandatory `key_field` option. Every BM25 index needs a `key_field`,
  which should be the name of a column that will function as a row's unique
  identifier within the index. Additionally, the `key_field` must be the first field
  in the list of columns. See [choosing a key field](/documentation/indexing/create_index#choosing-a-key-field) for more details.
</Note>

We're now ready to execute a full-text search. We'll look for the first five rows with a `rating` greater than `2` where `description` matches `shoes`
or `category` matches `footwear`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes' OR category @@@ 'footwear' AND rating @@@ '>2'
ORDER BY description
LIMIT 5;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
     description      | rating | category
----------------------+--------+----------
 Comfortable slippers |      3 | Footwear
 Generic shoes        |      4 | Footwear
 Sleek running shoes  |      5 | Footwear
 Sturdy hiking boots  |      4 | Footwear
 White jogging shoes  |      3 | Footwear
(5 rows)
```
</Accordion>

The ParadeDB-specific `@@@` operator instructs ParadeDB to execute a full-text search using the BM25 index. Its job is to return matching rows as quickly as possible in no
particular order. To sort by relevance, the `paradedb.score` function generates BM25 scores for each row.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category, paradedb.score(id)
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes' OR category @@@ 'footwear' AND rating @@@ '>2'
ORDER BY score DESC, description
LIMIT 5;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
     description      | rating | category |   score
----------------------+--------+----------+-----------
 Generic shoes        |      4 | Footwear | 5.8135376
 Sleek running shoes  |      5 | Footwear | 5.4211845
 White jogging shoes  |      3 | Footwear | 5.4211845
 Comfortable slippers |      3 | Footwear | 2.9362776
 Sturdy hiking boots  |      4 | Footwear | 2.9362776
(5 rows)
```
</Accordion>

The result table shows that rows matching on both `description` and `category` scored more highly than rows matching only one of the fields.

Finally, let's see how ParadeDB handles a phrase query like `white shoes`. Let's also surface results even
if there is a word between `white` and `shoes` using the `~` slop operator.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '"white shoes"~1'
LIMIT 5;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
     description     | rating | category
---------------------+--------+----------
 White jogging shoes |      3 | Footwear
(1 row)
```
</Accordion>

In addition to simple string queries, ParadeDB supports advanced [query builder functions](/documentation/advanced) similar to the Elastic DSL.

## Joined Search

ParadeDB supports full text search over JOINs, which is crucial for database schemas that store data in a normalized fashion. To demonstrate, let's create a table
called `orders` that references `mock_items`.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25_test_table(
  schema_name => 'public',
  table_name => 'orders',
  table_type => 'Orders'
);

ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT foreign_key_product_id
FOREIGN KEY (product_id)
REFERENCES mock_items(id);

SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
 order_id | product_id | order_quantity | order_total | customer_name
----------+------------+----------------+-------------+---------------
        1 |          1 |              3 |       99.99 | John Doe
        2 |          2 |              1 |       49.99 | Jane Smith
        3 |          3 |              5 |      249.95 | Alice Johnson
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

Next, let's create a BM25 index over the `orders` table.

```sql
CREATE INDEX orders_idx ON orders
USING bm25 (order_id, customer_name)
WITH (key_field='order_id');
```

The following query searches for rows where `customer_name` matches `Johnson` and `description` matches `shoes`.

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, o.customer_name, m.description
FROM orders o
JOIN mock_items m ON o.product_id = m.id
WHERE o.customer_name @@@ 'Johnson' AND m.description @@@ 'shoes'
ORDER BY order_id
LIMIT 5;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
 order_id | customer_name |     description
----------+---------------+---------------------
        3 | Alice Johnson | Sleek running shoes
        6 | Alice Johnson | White jogging shoes
       36 | Alice Johnson | White jogging shoes
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

## Similarity Search

For vector similarity search, let's first generate a vector embeddings column. For the sake of this tutorial, we'll
randomly generate these embeddings.

```sql
ALTER TABLE mock_items ADD COLUMN embedding vector(3);

UPDATE mock_items m
SET embedding = ('[' ||
    ((m.id + 1) % 10 + 1)::integer || ',' ||
    ((m.id + 2) % 10 + 1)::integer || ',' ||
    ((m.id + 3) % 10 + 1)::integer || ']')::vector;

SELECT description, rating, category, embedding
FROM mock_items
LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
``` csv
       description        | rating |  category   | embedding
--------------------------+--------+-------------+-----------
 Ergonomic metal keyboard |      4 | Electronics | [3,4,5]
 Plastic Keyboard         |      4 | Electronics | [4,5,6]
 Sleek running shoes      |      5 | Footwear    | [5,6,7]
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

Next, let's create an HNSW index on the `embedding` column of our table.
While not required, an HNSW index can drastically improve query performance over very large datasets.

```sql
CREATE INDEX on mock_items
USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

Next, let's query our table with a vector and order the results by cosine distance:

```sql
SELECT description, category, rating, embedding
FROM mock_items
ORDER BY embedding <=> '[1,2,3]', description
LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
       description        |  category  | rating | embedding
--------------------------+------------+--------+-----------
 Artistic ceramic vase    | Home Decor |      4 | [1,2,3]
 Designer wall paintings  | Home Decor |      5 | [1,2,3]
 Handcrafted wooden frame | Home Decor |      5 | [1,2,3]
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

That's it! Next, let's [load your data](/documentation/getting-started/load) to start running real queries.
