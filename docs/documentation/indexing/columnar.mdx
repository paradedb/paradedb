By default, all non-JSON fields are indexed using ParadeDB's columnar format.
This enables fast [filtering pushdown](documentation/filtering#filter-pushdown), [Top N ordering](/documentation/sorting/topn), and
[aggregates](/documentation/aggregates/overview) over these fields. For example, in the following index definition, `id`, `description`, and `rating` are all columnar indexed
by default.

```sql
CREATE INDEX search_idx ON mock_items
USING bm25 (id, description, rating)
WITH (key_field = 'id');
```

To disable columnar indexing for a text field, set `fast` to `false` in the field configuration.

```sql
CREATE INDEX search_idx ON mock_items
USING bm25 (id, description, rating)
WITH (
    key_field = 'id',
    text_fields = '{"description": {"fast": false}}'
);
```

When using [tokenizer casts](/documentation/tokenizers/overview), columnar can be explicitly controlled with the `columnar` option.

```sql
CREATE INDEX search_idx ON mock_items
USING bm25 (id, (description::pdb.unicode_words('columnar=false')), rating)
WITH (key_field = 'id');
```

<Note>
  The `columnar` option for tokenizers is available in versions `0.22.0` and
  above.
</Note>

<Note>
Columnar storage stores the raw text value regardless of the tokenizer. For example, if `Hello world` is
split into tokens `hello` and `world`, the columnar value remains `Hello world`.

This is important because operations like filtering and sorting require the original field value, not the tokens.

</Note>

<Note>
  JSON fields default to columnar `false` because their fast fields do not
  contain the full content of the JSON in a way that can be directly rendered —
  the individual fields are exploded into dynamic columns.
</Note>

<Note>
  Internally, Tantivy refers to columnar fields as fast fields. Our [legacy
  docs](/legacy/indexing/create-index) also refer to these fields as fast.
