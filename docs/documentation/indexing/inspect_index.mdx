title: Inspect an Index
---

## Index Schema

The `schema` function returns a table with information about the index schema. This is useful for inspecting how an index was configured.

The following code block inspects an index called `search_idx`. The argument should be the index name as a symbol, as opposed to quoted in a string.

```sql
SELECT * FROM paradedb.schema(search_idx);
```

<ParamField body="index" required>
	The index to inspect.
</ParamField>


## Index Size

Because BM25 indexes rely on a custom storage implementation, the built-in Postgres `pg_relation_size` function does not work. Instead, the custom
`index_size` function returns the size of a BM25 index in bytes.

The following code block returns the size of an index called `search_idx`. The argument should be the index name as a symbol, as opposed to quoted in a string.

```sql
SELECT * FROM paradedb.index_size(search_idx);
```

<ParamField body="index" required>
	The index to inspect.
</ParamField>
