## Basic Usage

The `record` option specifies how much information is recorded with an indexed field. By default, all fields use `position`.

```sql
CREATE INDEX search_idx ON mock_items
USING bm25 (id, description)
WITH (
    key_field='id',
    text_fields='{
        "description": {"record": "freq"}
    }'
);
```

<ParamField body="basic">Records only the document IDs.</ParamField>
<ParamField body="freq">
  Records the document IDs as well as term frequency. This is useful for BM25
  scoring.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="position">
  Records the document ID, term frequency and positions of occurrences. Required
  to run a phrase query.
</ParamField>
