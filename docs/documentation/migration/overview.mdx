title: Migrating from Elasticsearch
description: Guides for migrating your search workloads from Elasticsearch to ParadeDB
canonical: https://docs.paradedb.com/documentation/migration/overview

This section is for developers who are evaluating or actively migrating from Elasticsearch (or OpenSearch) to ParadeDB.
ParadeDB delivers Elastic-quality full-text search as a Postgres extension, so your data, queries, and infrastructure
all live inside Postgres — no ETL pipelines, no separate cluster to manage.

## Key Differences

Before diving into the detailed guides, here are the most important conceptual differences:

|                     | Elasticsearch                                | ParadeDB                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Query language**  | JSON DSL                                     | Standard SQL with search operators             |
| **Data model**      | Denormalized documents                       | Normalized relational tables with JOINs        |
| **Transactions**    | Per-document atomicity, eventual consistency | Full ACID transactions                         |
| **Index storage**   | Separate cluster                             | Inside Postgres (same database)                |
| **Schema changes**  | Dynamic mapping or reindex                   | Defined at index creation; `REINDEX` to change |
| **Updates/deletes** | Expensive (reindex internally)               | Native Postgres operations                     |

## Migration Tips

<Note>
  ParadeDB's `pdb.agg()` function accepts **Elasticsearch-compatible JSON** for
  aggregations, so many of your existing aggregation queries can be reused with
  minimal changes. See the [aggregation
  section](/documentation/migration/elasticsearch-query-mapping#aggregations) of
  the query mapping guide.
</Note>

- **Start with your most common queries.** Map your highest-traffic Elasticsearch queries first using the
  [query syntax mapping](/documentation/migration/elasticsearch-query-mapping) guide.
- **Use SQL JOINs instead of denormalization.** Elasticsearch requires denormalized documents, but ParadeDB supports
  full SQL JOINs. You can normalize your schema and simplify your data model.
- **Leverage Postgres tooling.** Backups, replication, monitoring, and CI/CD integrate with standard Postgres tools
  you may already use.
- **Check the feature comparison for gaps.** Review the [feature comparison](/documentation/migration/elasticsearch-feature-comparison)
  to identify any Elasticsearch features your application depends on that ParadeDB does not yet support.
