## Welcome to `v2`

ParadeDB is undergoing a revamp to make its SQL interface more intuitive and ORM-friendly.
This new experience is being introduced as `v2` of the API.

To move back to the v1 API at any time click `Documentation` in the left navigation bar.

`v1` will remain fully supported — there’s no need to change existing integrations.
`v2` focuses on improving developer experience across three key areas:

### Declarative Schema Configuration

No more complex JSON strings to configure tokenizers, fast fields, etc.

### Transparent Search Operators

More intuitive syntax and more transparent behavior, making it easier to understand exactly what's happening just by reading the SQL query.

### ORM-Friendly Query Builders

Queries will support structured column references instead of relying on string literals, improving compatibility with query builders and reducing runtime errors.

## Rollout Timeline

The `v2` API will be rolled out iteratively, with new features and improvements added to this section of the documentation as they land.
During this period, users are encouraged to explore the new features and provide feedback as we refine the interface.

`v2` is targeted to be released with full coverage of the `v1` API by the end of October 2025.
