ParadeDB uses PostgreSQL operators and functions to enable full text and similarity search over Postgres tables.

All code blocks in this section reference a table called `mock_items` and a BM25 index called `search_idx`, which were created in the
[quickstart](/documentation/getting-started/quickstart). We recommend going through the [quickstart](/documentation/getting-started/quickstart) first to develop a feel for the API
and create the example BM25 index.
