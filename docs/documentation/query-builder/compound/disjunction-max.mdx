title: Disjunction Max
description: Search for documents matching the best of several subqueries
canonical: https://docs.paradedb.com/documentation/query-builder/compound/disjunction-max
---

Returns documents that match one or more of the specified subqueries. If a document matches multiple criteria, it receives the highest score from those matches.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category, pdb.score(id)
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.disjunction_max(ARRAY[
  paradedb.term('description', 'shoes'),
  paradedb.term('description', 'running')
]);
```

<div className="mt-8" />

<ParamField body="disjuncts" required>
  Query objects to match against.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="tie_breaker" default={0}>
  A tie breaking increment for matching subqueries. Should be a float between
  `0` and `1`.
</ParamField>

If `tie_breaker` is provided, documents that match on more than one subquery will score higher
than documents that match on only one subquery. For instance, if there are two subqueries and `tie_breaker` is set to
`0.5`, the score is computed as:

```
max_score + (second_highest_score × 0.5)
```
