In addition to basic [match](/documentation/full-text/match), [phrase](/documentation/full-text/phrase), and
[term](/documentation/full-text/term) queries, additional advanced query types are exposed as query builder functions.

Query builder functions use the `@@@` operator. `@@@` takes a column on the left-hand side and a query builder function on the
right-hand side. It means "find all rows where the column matches the given query."

For example:

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ pdb.regex('key.*rd');
```

```python Django
from paradedb import ParadeDB, Regex

MockItem.objects.filter(
    description=ParadeDB(Regex('key.*rd'))
).values('description', 'rating', 'category')
```

</CodeGroup>

```ini Expected Response
       description        | rating |  category
--------------------------+--------+-------------
 Ergonomic metal keyboard |      4 | Electronics
 Plastic Keyboard         |      4 | Electronics
(2 rows)
```

This uses the [regex](/documentation/query-builder/term/regex) builder function to match all rows where `description` matches the regex expression `key.*rd`.
