ParadeDB is highly optimized for quickly returning the Top N results out of the index. In SQL, this means queries that contain an `ORDER BY...LIMIT`:

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description ||| 'running shoes'
ORDER BY rating
LIMIT 5;
```

In order for a Top N query to be executed by ParadeDB vs. vanilla Postgres, all of the following conditions must be met:

1. All `ORDER BY` fields must be indexed. If they are text fields, they [must use the literal tokenizer](#sorting-by-text).
2. At least one ParadeDB text search operator must be present at the same level as the `ORDER BY...LIMIT`.
3. The query must have a `LIMIT`.
4. With the exception of `lower`, ordering by expressions is not supported -- only the raw fields themselves.

To verify that ParadeDB is executing the Top N, look for a `Custom Scan` with a `TopNScanExecState` in the `EXPLAIN` output:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description ||| 'running shoes'
ORDER BY rating
LIMIT 5;
```

(10 rows)
```
</Accordion>

If any of the above conditions are not met, the query cannot be fully optimized and you will not see a `TopNScanExecState` in the `EXPLAIN` output.

## Tiebreaker Sorting

To guarantee stable sorting in the event of a tie, additional columns can be provided to `ORDER BY`:

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description ||| 'running shoes'
ORDER BY rating, id
LIMIT 5;
```

<Note>
  ParadeDB is currently able to handle 3 `ORDER BY` columns. If there are more
  than 3 columns, the `ORDER BY` will not be efficiently executed by ParadeDB.
</Note>

## Sorting by Text

If a text field is present in the `ORDER BY` clause, it must be indexed with the [literal](/documentation/tokenizers/available-tokenizers/literal) or
[literal normalized](/documentation/tokenizers/available-tokenizers/literal-normalized) tokenizer.

Sorting by lowercase text using `lower(<text_field>)` is also supported. To enable this, the expression `lower(<text_field>)` must be indexed
with either the literal or literal normalized tokenizer. See [indexing expressions](/documentation/indexing/indexing-expressions) for more information.

```sql
CREATE INDEX search_idx ON mock_items
USING bm25 (id, (lower(description)::pdb.literal))
WITH (key_field='id');
```

This allows sorting by lowercase to be optimized.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description ||| 'sleek running shoes'
ORDER BY lower(description)
LIMIT 5;
```

## Sorting by JSON

Ordering by JSON subfield is on the roadmap but not yet supported. For example, this query will not receive an optimized
Top N scan:

```sql
SELECT id, description, metadata
FROM mock_items
WHERE description ||| 'sleek running shoes'
ORDER BY metadata->'weight'
LIMIT 5;
```
