title: Literal Normalized
description: Like the literal tokenizer, but allows for token filters

---

The literal normalized tokenizer is similar to the [literal](/documentation/tokenizers/available-tokenizers/literal) tokenizer in that it does not split the source text.
All text is treated as a single token, regardless of how many words are contained.

However, unlike the literal tokenizer, this tokenizer allows [token filters](/documentation/token-filters/overview) to be applied. By default, the literal normalized tokenizer
also [lowercases](/documentation/token-filters/lowercase) the text.

```sql
CREATE INDEX search_idx ON mock_items
USING bm25 (id, (description::pdb.literal_normalized))
WITH (key_field='id');
```

To get a feel for this tokenizer, run the following command and replace the text with your own:

```sql
SELECT 'Tokenize me!'::pdb.literal_normalized::text[];
```

```ini Expected Response
       text
------------------
 {"tokenize me!"}
(1 row)
```
