title: Literal Normalized
description: Like the literal tokenizer, but allows for token filters
canonical: https://docs.paradedb.com/documentation/tokenizers/available-tokenizers/literal-normalized

<Note>
  For all patch versions greater than `0.20.8` in the `20` minor version, and
  all patch versions greater than `0.21.4` in the `21` minor version, fields
  using the [literal
  normalized](/documentation/tokenizers/available-tokenizers/literal-normalized)
  tokenizer are also columnar indexed. This means that they can be used in
  [aggregates](/documentation/aggregates/overview) and [Top N
  queries](/documentation/sorting/topn). Indexes created prior to these versions
  must be reindexed to use this feature.
</Note>

The literal normalized tokenizer is similar to the [literal](/documentation/tokenizers/available-tokenizers/literal) tokenizer in that it does not split the source text.
All text is treated as a single token, regardless of how many words are contained.

However, unlike the literal tokenizer, this tokenizer allows [token filters](/documentation/token-filters/overview) to be applied. By default, the literal normalized tokenizer
also [lowercases](/documentation/token-filters/lowercase) the text.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL
CREATE INDEX search_idx ON mock_items
USING bm25 (id, (description::pdb.literal_normalized))
WITH (key_field='id');
```

```python Django
from django.db import models
from paradedb.indexes import BM25Index

class MockItem(models.Model):
    description = models.TextField()

    class Meta:
        indexes = [
            BM25Index(
                fields={
                    'id': {},
                    'description': {'tokenizer': 'literal_normalized'},
                },
                key_field='id',
                name='search_idx',
            ),
        ]
```

To get a feel for this tokenizer, run the following command and replace the text with your own:

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL
SELECT 'Tokenize me!'::pdb.literal_normalized::text[];
```

```python Django
# Coming soon
```

</CodeGroup>

```ini Expected Response
       text
------------------
 {"tokenize me!"}
(1 row)
```
