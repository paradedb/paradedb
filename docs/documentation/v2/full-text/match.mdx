## Match Disjunction

### Quick Example

Match queries are the go-to query type for text search in ParadeDB and use the `|||` match disjunction operator. `|||` means "find all documents that contain one or more of the terms tokenized from this text input." To understand what this looks like in practice, let's consider the following query:

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description ||| 'running shoes';
```

This query returns:

```csv
     description     | rating | category
---------------------+--------+----------
 Sleek running shoes |      5 | Footwear
 White jogging shoes |      3 | Footwear
 Generic shoes       |      4 | Footwear
(3 rows)
```

### How It Works

To see why, let's look at what the `|||` operator does:

1. Retrieves the [tokenizer configuration](/documentation/indexing/tokenizers) of the `description` column. In this example,
   let's assume `description` uses the [default](/documentation/indexing/tokenizers#default) tokenizer, which splits on whitespace
   and punctuation.
2. Tokenizes the query string with the same tokenizer. This means `running shoes` becomes two tokens: `running` and `shoes`.
3. Finds all rows where `description` contains **any one** of the tokens, `running` or `shoes`.

This is why all results have either `running` or `shoes` tokens in `description`.

### More Examples

Let's consider a few more hypothetical documents to see whether they would be returned by match disjunction.
These examples assume that index uses the default tokenizer and token filters.

| Document            | Tokens                      | Matches? | Reason                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Sleek running shoes | `sleek`, `running`, `shoes` | ✅       | Contains both `running` and `shoes`.    |
| Running shoes sleek | `sleek`, `running`, `shoes` | ✅       | Contains both `running` and `shoes`.    |
| SLeeK RUNNING ShOeS | `sleek`, `running`, `shoes` | ✅       | Contains both `running` and `shoes`.    |
| Sleek run shoe      | `sleek`, `run`, `shoe`      | ❌       | Contains neither `running` nor `shoes`. |
| Sleke ruining shoez | `sleke`, `ruining`, `shoez` | ❌       | Contains neither `running` nor `shoes`. |
| White jogging shoes | `white`, `jogging`, `shoes` | ✅       | Contains `shoes`.                       |

## Match Conjunction

### Quick Example

Suppose we want to find rows that contain both `running` AND `shoes` tokens. This is where the `&&&` match conjunction operator comes in.
`&&&` means "find all documents that contain all terms tokenized from this text input."

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description &&& 'running shoes';
```

This query returns:

```csv
     description     | rating | category
---------------------+--------+----------
 Sleek running shoes |      5 | Footwear
(1 row)
```

Note that `White jogging shoes` and `Generic shoes` are no longer returned because they do not have the token `running`.

### How It Works

Match conjunction works exactly like match disjunction, except for one key distinction. Instead of finding documents containing
at least one matching token from the query, it finds documents where **all tokens** from the query are a match.

### More Examples

Let’s consider a few more hypothetical documents to see whether they would be returned by match conjunction.
These examples assume that index uses the default tokenizer and token filters.

| Document            | Tokens                      | Matches? | Reason                                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Sleek running shoes | `sleek`, `running`, `shoes` | ✅       | Contains both `running` and `shoes`.         |
| Running shoes sleek | `sleek`, `running`, `shoes` | ✅       | Contains both `running` and `shoes`.         |
| SLeeK RUNNING ShOeS | `sleek`, `running`, `shoes` | ✅       | Contains both `running` and `shoes`.         |
| Sleek run shoe      | `sleek`, `run`, `shoe`      | ❌       | Contains neither `running` nor `shoes`.      |
| Sleke ruining shoez | `sleke`, `ruining`, `shoez` | ❌       | Does not contain both `running` and `shoes`. |
| White jogging shoes | `white`, `jogging`, `shoes` | ❌       | Does not contain both `running` and `shoes`. |

## Fuzzy Matching

Fuzzy matching has not yet been implemented in `v2`. Please continue to use `v1` for this capability.
