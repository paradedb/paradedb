## Limit

Passing `LIMIT` into a query can significantly improve query times for queries that return large result sets.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes'
LIMIT 5;
```

## Offset

`OFFSET` can be used with `LIMIT` to paginate through results.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes'
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;
```
