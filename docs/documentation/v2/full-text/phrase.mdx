title: Phrase

Phrase queries work exactly like [match](/documentation/full-text/phrase) queries, but are more strict in that they require the
order and position of tokens to be the same. For instance, suppose our query is `running shoes`, and we want to omit results like
`running sleek shoes` or `shoes running` — these results contain the right tokens, but not in the exact order and position
that the query specifies.

Enter the `###` phrase operator:

```sql
INSERT INTO mock_items (description, rating, category) VALUES
('running sleek shoes', 5, 'Footwear'),
('shoes running', 5, 'Footwear');

SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description ### 'running shoes';
```

This query returns:

```csv
     description     | rating | category
---------------------+--------+----------
 Sleek running shoes |      5 | Footwear
(1 row)
```

Note that `running sleek shoes` and `shoes running` did not match the phrase `running shoes` despite having the tokens `running` and
`shoes` because they appear in the wrong order or with other words in between.

## Slop

Slop allows phrase queries to be relaxed a bit. It specifies how many changes — like extra words in between or swapped word positions — are allowed while still considering the phrase a match.

For example, searching for `sleek shoes` with a slop of `1` would match `sleek running shoes` because there is one word, `running`, between
`sleek` and `shoes`.
