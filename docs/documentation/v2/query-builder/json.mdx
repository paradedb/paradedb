title: JSON Query Syntax
---

ParadeDB also supports writing query builder functions as JSON objects.
This is useful for programmatic generation or client applications that construct search queries as structured JSON
-- for all other use cases, we do not recommend using this syntax.

For example, the previous regex query can be written in JSON form as:

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@
'{
    "regex": {
        "pattern": "key.*rd"
    }
}'::pdb.query;
```

<Note>
The JSON query object must be explicitly cast to `pdb.query` using `::pdb.query`.
