In addition to basic [match](/documentation/v2/full-text/match), [phrase](/documentation/v2/full-text/phrase), and
[term](/documentation/v2/full-text/term) queries, more complex query types are exposed as query builder functions
for advanced use cases.

Users familiar with Elasticsearch may notice that these query builder functions are similar to those found in Elastic’s query DSL.
This is intentional — ParadeDB uses the same terminology as Elasticsearch for its query types.
