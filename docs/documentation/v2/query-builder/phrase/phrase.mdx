title: Phrase
---

Under the hood, the [phrase operator](/documentation/v2/full-text/phrase) gets rewritten to this query builder function.
By default we recommend using the [phrase operator](/documentation/v2/full-text/term) instead of this function.

## Basic Usage

Searches for documents containing a [phrase](/documentation/concepts/phrase).

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ pdb.phrase(ARRAY['running', 'shoes']);
```
<div className="mt-8" />

<ParamField body="phrases" required>
  An `ARRAY` of words that form the search phrase. These words must appear in
  the specified order within the document for a match to occur, although some
  flexibility is allowed based on the `slop` parameter.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="slop" default={0}>
  A slop of `0` requires the terms to appear exactly as they are in the phrase
  and adjacent to each other. Higher slop values allow for more distance between
  the terms.
</ParamField>

Setting slop equal to `n` allows `n` terms to come in between the terms in the phrase as well
as term transpositions.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ pdb.phrase(ARRAY['running', 'shoes'], 1);
```
