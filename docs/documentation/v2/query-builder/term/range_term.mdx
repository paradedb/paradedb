title: Range Term
---

`range_term` is the equivalent of Postgres' operators over [range types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rangetypes.html).
It supports operations like range containment, overlap, and intersection.

## Term Contains

In this example, `weight_range` is an `int4range` type.
The following query finds all rows where `weight_range` contains `1`:

```sql
SELECT id, weight_range FROM mock_items
WHERE weight_range @@@ pdb.range_term(1);
```

## Range Intersects

The following query finds all ranges that share at least one common
point with the query range:

```sql
SELECT id, weight_range FROM mock_items
WHERE weight_range @@@ pdb.range_term('(10, 12]'::int4range, 'Intersects');
```
## Range Contains

The following query finds all ranges that are contained by the query range:

```sql
SELECT id, weight_range FROM mock_items
WHERE weight_range @@@ pdb.range_term('(3, 9]'::int4range, 'Contains');
```

## Range Within

The following query finds all ranges that contain the query range:

```sql
SELECT id, weight_range FROM mock_items
WHERE weight_range @@@ pdb.range_term('(2, 11]'::int4range, 'Within');
```
