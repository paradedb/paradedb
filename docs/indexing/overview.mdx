## What is an Index?

In Postgres, indexes are database objects that provide a fast way to look up rows in a table. If you
imagine a Postgres table as a book, then an index is like the table of contents. Instead of flipping
through every page to find a chapter, the table of contents stores additional information that enables
readers to locate a chapter much faster.

By default, Postgres comes with several index types that are used to index different types of
data. For instance, numeric data types might be indexed using a B-tree (Balanced Tree) index, whereas
arrays might be indexed using a GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) index.

## ParadeDB Indexes

ParadeDB relies on two new index types to power its search capabilities: the BM25 index, for full text search,
and the HNSW index, for similarity search. These indexes can be created over the tables or columns you wish to
search over.

Once an index is created, it will automatically stay in sync with the underlying table data, and
does not need to be re-created unless the table schema changes (for instance, if a column is renamed or deleted). ParadeDB
offers *weak consistency* between the table and the index, meaning that the index will eventually be updated to reflect the
table data, but there may be a short delay between the table data changing and the index reflecting that change. Your mileage
may vary depending on the size of your table and the number of concurrent writes. This is so that indexing data does not slow
down the transactions.
