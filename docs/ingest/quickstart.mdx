Today, a vast amount of data is stored outside of Postgres in

1. **File formats** like Parquet or CSV
2. **Data lakes** like S3 or GCS
3. **Table formats** like Delta Lake or Iceberg

Ingesting this data into ParadeDB with data processing engines or ETL tools is complex and error-prone.
ParadeDB makes it easy to consume this data using nothing but SQL commands.

## Basic Usage

In the following example, we will query and copy a Parquet file stored in S3 to Postgres. The Parquet file
contains 3 million NYC taxi trips from January 2024, hosted in a public S3 bucket provided by ParadeDB.

To begin, let's create a [Postgres foreign data wrapper](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers), which is how ParadeDB connects to S3.

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER parquet_wrapper
HANDLER parquet_fdw_handler VALIDATOR parquet_fdw_validator;

CREATE SERVER parquet_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER parquet_wrapper;

CREATE FOREIGN TABLE trips ()
SERVER parquet_server
OPTIONS (files 's3://paradedb-benchmarks/yellow_tripdata_2024-01.parquet');
```

Next, let's query the foreign table `trips`. You'll notice that the column names and types of this table are automatically
inferred from the Parquet file.

```sql
SELECT vendorid, passenger_count, trip_distance FROM trips LIMIT 1;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
  ```csv vendorid | passenger_count | trip_distance
  ----------+-----------------+--------------- 2 | 1 | 1.72 (1 row) ```
</Accordion>

Queries over this table are powered by [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org), an in-process analytical query engine.
This means that you can run fast analytical queries over data lakes from ParadeDB.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trips;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
  ```csv count --------- 2964624 (1 row) ```
</Accordion>

Finally, let's copy this table into a Postgres heap table. For demonstration, we will
copy over the first 100 rows.

```sql
CREATE TABLE trips_copy AS SELECT * FROM trips LIMIT 100;
```

That's it! Please refer to the other sections for instructions on how to ingest from other file formats,
table formats, and object stores.

## For Further Assistance

The `paradedb.help` function opens a GitHub Discussion that the ParadeDB team will respond to.

```sql
SELECT paradedb.help(
  subject => $$Something isn't working$$,
  body => $$Issue description$$
);
