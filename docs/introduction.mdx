Retake is real-time keyword (BM25) + semantic (kNN) search (i.e. neural search) infrastructure for developers,
built to stay in sync with fast-changing databases. Retake acts as a search layer around any Postgres database and
provides a straightforward SDK for developers to add search over Postgres to any Python application.

## Why Retake

Retake is a good fit for developers that

1. Have investigated vector databases for semantic search, but also want the capabilities of traditional search
   (e.g. keyword-based search, faceting, filtering, ranking, etc.).
2. Are looking for an opinionated neural search library that "just works" without the overhead of managing a vector store,
   search engine, embedding models, and data pipelines.

## Key Features

**Always in Sync**

Retake leverages Kafka to integrate directly with Postgres. As data changes or new data arrives,
Retake ensures that the indexed data is kept in sync.

**Intelligent Vector Cache**

Whenever data is changed in Postgres, Retake updates the embedding/vector representation of that data behind the scenes.
Vectors are automatically cached for lightning-fast query results with semantic understanding.

**Low-Code SDK**

Retake provides intuitive search SDKs that drop into any Python application (other languages coming soon).
The core API is just a few functions.

**Open/ElasticSearch DSL Compatible**

Retake's query interface is built on top of the the high-level OpenSearch Python client, enabling developers
to query with the full expressiveness of the OpenSearch DSL (domain-specific language).

**Deployable Anywhere**

Retake is deployable anywhere, from a laptop to a distributed cloud system.
