## Basic Usage

Identifies documents containing a phrase followed by a term prefix.

<CodeGroup>
```sql Function Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.phrase_prefix('description', ARRAY['running', 'sh']);
```
```sql JSON Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@
'{
    "phrase_prefix": {
        "field": "description",
        "phrases": ["running", "sh"]
    }
}'::jsonb;
```
</CodeGroup>

<div className="mt-8" />

<ParamField body="field" required>
  Specifies the field within the document to search for the term.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="phrases" required>
  An `ARRAY` of words that the search is looking to match, followed by a term
  prefix rather than a complete term.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="max_expansions">
  Limits the number of term variations that the prefix can expand to during the
  search. This helps in controlling the breadth of the search by setting a cap
  on how many different terms the prefix can match.
</ParamField>
