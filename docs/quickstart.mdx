title: Quick Start
description: Add neural search to your Python app in under five minutes
---

In this tutorial, we will implement neural search over a
Postgres database using the `retakesearch` Python library. This tutorial will
only cover Retake-specific code and assumes that you already have a Python environment
where you would like to integrate Retake.

If you would like to see a full demo application using Retake, an example Python Flask app with
setup instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/getretake/search/tree/dev/examples/flask).

## Installation

<Info>**Prerequisite** Docker and Docker Compose must be installed.</Info>
<Warning>
  We are currently working on deploying to Docker hub and providing a Docker
  Compose file. This is a temporary installation workaround.
</Warning>

Clone the `retake` repository and run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This spins up the Retake engine, which is responsible forexecuting search queries and storing search data.
Next, `cd` into your Python project and install `retakesearch`.

```bash
pip install retakesearch
```

## Integrate with Postgres

Next, we use the Retake Python SDK to tell the Retake engine which tables and columns in Postgres we wish
to search over. As long as the Retake engine is running, this only needs to be done once.

```bash
from retakesearch import Client, Index, Database, Table

# When the Retake engine is run locally,
# this is the default API key/URL
client = Client(
  api_key="retake_test_key",
  url="http://localhost:8000"
)

# Provide your Postgres database credentials here
database = Database(
    host="***",
    user="***",
    password="***",
    port=5432,
)

# Provide the table name, primary key, and columns you
# wish to search over here
table = Table(
    name="faqs"
    primary_key="id",
    columns=["questions", "answers"],
    # Columns passed into neural_columns will have neural search enabled
    # Columns not included will only have keyword search enabled
    neural_columns=["questions", "answers"],
)

# Create an index
index = client.create_index("my_index")

# Populate the index with data from your table
# You can add multiple tables to the same index if you want
# to search over multiple tables in the same query
index.add_source(database, table)
```

## Execute a Search

Inside our Python application, we are ready to write and execute our first search query.

```bash
from retakesearch import Search

table_name = "faqs"

# This executes a full-text (BM25) search
bm25_search = Search().query("match", questions="Who am I?")
index.search(table_name, bm25_search)

# This executes a neural (BM25 + kNN) search
neural_search = Search().neuralQuery("Who am I?", ["questions"])
index.search(table_name, neural_search)
```

Note that Retake's `Search` query builder is a forked version of the
[high-level OpenSearch Python DSL client](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/clients/python-high-level).
Please refer to the [search guide]() for the essentials of writing search queries.

That's it! You've successfully executed a neural search query over your Postgres database.
