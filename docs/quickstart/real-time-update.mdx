title: "Send Real-Time Updates"

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You must have a real-time server running. It can either run
  on [your local computer](/deployment/local) or in the
  [cloud](/deployment/cloud).

  **Prerequisite** Your [source](/concepts/source) must have a table with at
  least one row.

Real-time updates are useful when the number of embeddings is very large and batch updates become expensive.
Retake provides a real-time server that listens for `Source` changes and incrementally updates the `Sink`.
Registering your source and sink with the real-time server is just three lines of code.

```bash main.py
from retake import RealtimeServer

# Please refer to the docker-compose.yml file for host and ports
# These are the default host/ports when you clone Retake
realtime_server = RealtimeServer(
  host="localhost",
  broker_port=9094,
  schema_registry_port=8081
)

# Send the connection details of your source and sink to the broker,
# which will automatically create and configure the connectors
pipeline.create_real_time(realtime_server)

# Tell the real-time server to start processing changes using the
# transforms you defined in the pipeline, and automatically push
# the results to the sink
pipeline.pipe_real_time(realtime_server)
```

That's it! As long as your real-time server continues to run, your Source and Sink are synced in real time.
