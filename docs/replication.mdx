title: Logical Replication
---

ParadeDB supports Postgres logical replication to replicate data between two ParadeDB instances or between a Postgres instance and a ParadeDB instance.

## Replicating data between two ParadeDB instances

If you are using ParadeDB as your primary Postgres and would like to configure read replicas

Here is an example Docker Compose file that sets up a primary/read-replicas configuration with ParadeDB:

```yaml
services:
  paradedb-master:
    image: paradedb/paradedb:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRESQL_USERNAME: myuser
      POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD: mypassword
      POSTGRESQL_DATABASE: mydatabase
      POSTGRESQL_POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres # Password for the superuser, required to install ParadeDB extensions
      POSTGRESQL_REPLICATION_MODE: master
      POSTGRESQL_REPLICATION_USER: myreplicationuser
      POSTGRESQL_REPLICATION_PASSWORD: myreplicationpassword
      PARADEDB_TELEMETRY: true # Set to 'false' (or remove) to disable anonymous telemetry
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - paradedb_master_data:/bitnami/postgresql

  paradedb-slave:
    image: paradedb/paradedb:latest
    depends_on:
      - paradedb-master
    environment:
      POSTGRESQL_USERNAME: myuser
      POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD: mypassword
      POSTGRESQL_DATABASE: mydatabase
      POSTGRESQL_POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres # Password for the superuser, required to install ParadeDB extensions
      POSTGRESQL_REPLICATION_MODE: slave
      POSTGRESQL_REPLICATION_USER: myreplicationuser
      POSTGRESQL_REPLICATION_PASSWORD: myreplicationpassword
      POSTGRESQL_MASTER_HOST: paradedb-master
      POSTGRESQL_MASTER_PORT_NUMBER: 5432
      PARADEDB_TELEMETRY: true # Set to 'false' (or remove) to disable anonymous telemetry

volumes:
  paradedb_master_data:
```

## Replicating data between a Postgres instance and a ParadeDB instance

If you already have a primary Postgres instance, for instance on a managed Postgres-as-a-Service provider, and would like
to replicate data to a ParadeDB instance to serve as a search and analytics node, you can use Postgres logical replication.
