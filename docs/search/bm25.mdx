title: Full Text (BM25) Search

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** Before performing full text search over a table, it must
  first be [indexed](indexing/bm25).

## Overview

Full text search uses the BM25 algorithm to find rows in a table that match a query. This type of search
is especially useful for matching exact keywords inside documents.

## Basic Usage

The custom `@@@` operator signifies a full text search. The left-hand side of the `@@@` accepts the
name of the table, and the right-hand side accepts the query.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ 'keyboard'
```

## Column-Specific Queries

If your table has multiple text columns, you can specify which column to search:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ 'description:keyboard'
```

## Phrases

Phrases should be wrapped in double quotes:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ '"metal keyboard"'
```

## BM25 Scoring

The `paradedb.rank_bm25` function returns a column with each row's BM25 score. It makes use of the
hidden `ctid` Postgres system column to match each row to a score:

```sql
SELECT *, paradedb.rank_bm25(ctid)
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ 'keyboard'
```

## Highlighting

The `paradedb.highlight_bm25` function returns highlighted fragments of text that match your
query. This function only works over text fields.

```sql
SELECT *, paradedb.highlight_bm25(ctid, 'description')
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ 'keyboard'
```

## Filtering

The standard SQL `WHERE` clause is used perform range and filter queries:

### Numeric

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ 'keyboard'
AND rating>=3;
```

### Timestamp

```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table
WHERE mock_items @@@ 'keyboard'
WHERE purchase_date > '2023-01-01 12:00:00-05';
```

## Boolean Operators

`AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` can be used to combine and filter multiple terms:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ 'keyboard OR toy NOT metal'
```

Use parentheses to group terms and control the order of operations:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ '(keyboard OR toy) AND metal'
```

## Set Operator

The set operator is a more CPU-efficient way of combining multiple `OR`s:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ 'description:IN [keyboard, toy]'
```

## Slop Operator

The `~` slop operator is used to match phrases separated by words in between. For instance, let's say
there exists a row with `description` set to "ergonomic metal keyboard." Because words "ergonomic" and "keyboard"
are separated by one word, the following query would return find row:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ '"ergonomic keyboard"~1'
```

## Special Characters

The special characters `+` , `^`, ```, `:`, `{`, `}`, `"`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `~`, `!`, `\\`, `\*`, and `SPACE`
must be escaped by a \ inside the query term.
