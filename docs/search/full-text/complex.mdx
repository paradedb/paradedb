title: Advanced Search Queries
---

## Overview

The `search` function that's generated for your index can accept query objects instead of a query string. Nearly all the query types implemented in Tantivy, our underlying search engine, are exposed to Postgres.

Query objects are composable, allowing for arbitrarily fine-grained queries. A query string itself is parsed into a query object, and can be used anywhere in a query tree with `paradedb.parse`.

`paradedb.parse` is implicitly performed if a query string is passed directly to the `search` function. These two queries are identical:

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:shoes');

SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(query => paradedb.parse('description:shoes'));
```

## Query Types

The `paradedb` schema exposes the following functions to construct query objects.

### All

This query type indiscriminately matches every document in the index, assigning a uniform score of 1.0 to each.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
    query => paradedb.all()
);
```

### Boolean

Boolean queries filter documents based on the logical relationships defined by their subqueries, considering:

- Documents that satisfy all `must` conditions.
- Documents that satisfy none of the `must_not` conditions.
- Documents that satisfy at least one condition from either `must` or `should`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
    query => paradedb.boolean(
	    should => ARRAY[
		    paradedb.parse('description:shoes'),
		    paradedb.phrase_prefix(field => 'description', phrases => ARRAY['book']),
		    paradedb.term(field => 'description', value => 'speaker'),
		    paradedb.fuzzy_term(field => 'description', value => 'wolo')
	    ]
    )
);
```

<ParamField body="must">
  A query object or an `ARRAY` of query objects as conditions which must be
  matched.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="must_not">
  A query object or an `ARRAY` of query objects as conditions which must not be
  matched.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="should">
  A query object or an `ARRAY` of query objects as conditions of which at least
  one must be matched.
</ParamField>

### Boost

A boost query wraps around another query to amplify its scoring impact, without altering the set of matched documents.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
	query => paradedb.boost(query => paradedb.all(), boost => 1.5)
);
```

<ParamField body="boost">
  The factor by which to multiply the score of each result.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query">The query to perform.</ParamField>

### Const Score

Applies a constant score across all documents matched by the underlying query. It can avoid unnecessary score computation on the wrapped query.

```
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
    query => paradedb.const_score(query => paradedb.all(), score => 3.9)
);
```

<ParamField body="score">The constant score to use for each result.</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query">The query to perform.</ParamField>

### Disjunction Max

Returns documents that match one or more of the specified subqueries. If a document matches multiple criteria, it receives the highest score from those matches, with a slight increase for any additional matches.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
	query => paradedb.disjunction_max(
		disjuncts => ARRAY[paradedb.parse('description:shoes')]
	)
);
```

<ParamField body="disjuncts">Query objects to match against.</ParamField>
<ParamField body="tie_breaker">
  A tie breaking increment for matching subqueries
</ParamField>

### Empty

Serves as a placeholder, matching no documents. It's useful for testing scenarios or specific edge cases.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
	query => paradedb.empty()
);
```

### Fuzzy Term

Fuzzy search allows users to obtain search results that approximately match the query term,
accommodating minor typos in the input. This enhances the search experience by
providing relevant results even when the query is not spelled correctly.

<Note>Highlighting is not currently supported for fuzzy search queries.</Note>

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
	query => paradedb.fuzzy_term(field => 'description', value => 'wolo')
);
```

<ParamField body="field">
  Specifies the field within the document to search for the term.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="value">
  Defines the term or phrase you are searching for within the specified field,
  using fuzzy logic based on Levenshtein distance to find similar terms.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="distance" default={2}>
  The maximum Levenshtein distance (i.e. single character edits) allowed to
  consider a term in the index as a match for the query term. Maximum value is
  `2`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="transpose_cost_one" default={true}>
  When set to `true`, transpositions (swapping two adjacent characters) as a
  single edit in the Levenshtein distance calculation, while `false` considers
  it two separate edits (a deletion and an insertion).
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="prefix" default={true}>
  When set to `true`, the initial substring (prefix) of the query term is
  exempted from the fuzzy edit distance calculation, while false includes the
  entire string in the calculation.
</ParamField>

### Phrase

Searches for documents containing an exact sequence of words, with `slop` allowing for some flexibility in term proximity. This query type also requires position indexing.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
	query => paradedb.phrase(
		field => 'description',
		phrases => ARRAY['robot', 'building', 'kit']
	)
);
```

<ParamField body="field">
  Specifies the field within the document to search for the term.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="phrases">
  An `ARRAY` of words that form the search phrase. These words must appear in
  the specified order within the document for a match to occur, although some
  flexibility is allowed based on the `slop` parameter.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="slop">
  A slop of 0 requires the terms to appear exactly as they are in the phrase and
  adjacent to each other. Higher slop values allow for more distance and
  flexibility between the terms, accommodating variations in the phrase's
  structure within the document.
</ParamField>

### Phrase Prefix

Identifies documents containing a given sequence of words followed by a term prefix, requiring the indexing of positions for the search field.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
	query => paradedb.phrase_prefix(
		field => 'description',
		phrases => ARRAY['har']
	)
);
```

<ParamField body="field">
  Specifies the field within the document to search for the term.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="phrases">
  An `ARRAY` of words that the search is looking to match, followed by a term
  prefix rather than a complete term.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="max_expansion">
  Limits the number of term variations that the prefix can expand to during the
  search. This helps in controlling the breadth of the search by setting a cap
  on how many different terms the prefix can match.
</ParamField>

### Range

Finds documents containing a term that falls within a specified range of values.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
  query => paradedb.range(
    field => 'rating',
    range => '[1,3)'::int4range
  ),
  stable_sort => true
);
```

<ParamField body="field">
  Specifies the field within the document to search for the term.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="range">
  A postgres range specifying the range of values to match the field against. Range types
  include `int4range`, `int8range`, `daterange`, `tsrange`, and `tstzrange`.
</ParamField>

### Regex

Finds documents containing terms that match a specific regex pattern, enabling pattern-based searching.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
	query => paradedb.regex(
		field => 'description',
		pattern => '(hardcover|plush|leather|running|wireless)'
	)
);
```

<ParamField body="field">
  Specifies the field within the document to search for the term.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="pattern">A regex pattern string.</ParamField>

### Term

Matches documents containing a specified term, with scoring based on term frequency, inverse document frequency, and field normalization. The term value passed is not tokenized for searching, it is matched directly against terms in the index.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
	query => paradedb.term(field => 'description', value => 'shoes')
);
```

<ParamField body="field">
  Specifies the field within the document to search for the term. If omitted,
  all indexed fields will be searched.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="value">Value to search for in the document field.</ParamField>

### TermSet

Matches documents containing any term from a specified set, offering flexibility in matching criteria.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
	query => paradedb.term_set(
	    terms => ARRAY[
	        paradedb.term(field => 'description', value => 'shoes'),
	        paradedb.term(field => 'description', value => 'novel')
	    ]
	)
);
```

<ParamField body="terms">
  An `ARRAY` of `paradedb.term` query objects.
</ParamField>
