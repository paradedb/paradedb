title: Highlighting
---

<Note>
The `highlight` function has been deprecated as of 0.8.5 and has been replaced with `snippet`, which follows new query syntax and has a different return type.
</Note>

## Overview

Highlighting refers to the practice of visually emphasizing the portions of a document that match a user's
search query. Highlighted snippets of text are by default wrapped in `<b></b>` tags. This can
be modified with the `prefix` and `postfix` arguments.

## Basic Usage

The `snippet` function takes a query and returns a table with three columns: the `key_field` of each result, its BM25 score,
and a highlighted snippet.

```sql
SELECT * FROM <index_name>.snippet(
  '<query>',
  highlight_field => '<highlight_field>'
);
```

<Accordion title="Example Usage">

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.snippet(
  'description:keyboard',
  highlight_field => 'description',
  max_num_chars => 100
);
```

</Accordion>

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the index.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query" required>
  The query string.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="highlight_field" required>
  The name of the field that will be highlighted in the result.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="prefix" default="<b>">
  The leading indicator around the highlighted region.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="postfix" default="</b>">
  The trailing indicator around the highlighted region.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="max_num_chars" default={150}>
  Max number of characters for a highlighted fragment.
</ParamField>

## Joining Snippets

Because `snippet` generates new `score_bm25` and `snippet` columns, the function does not return all the columns of the original table.
To map the columns of the original table the output of `snippet`, perform a JOIN on the `key_field` column.

```sql
-- Here, the key_field is "id"
WITH snippets AS (
    SELECT * FROM search_idx.snippet(
      'description:keyboard',
      highlight_field => 'description'
    )
)
SELECT snippets.id, description, snippet, score_bm25
FROM snippets
JOIN mock_items ON snippets.id = mock_items.id;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Output">
```csv
 id |       description        |             snippet             | score_bm25
----+--------------------------+---------------------------------+------------
  2 | Plastic Keyboard         | Plastic <b>Keyboard</b>         |  3.2668595
  1 | Ergonomic metal keyboard | Ergonomic metal <b>keyboard</b> |  2.8213787
(2 rows)
```
</Accordion>

## Removing Stale Rows

Unlike `search`, `snippet` bypasses the Postgres index access method and queries the index directly to obtain the BM25 score. As a result, dead tuples
that have been deleted may be factored into the results.

Running `VACUUM` on the underlying table will remove all dead rows from the index.

```sql
VACUUM mock_items;
```
