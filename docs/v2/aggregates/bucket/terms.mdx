A terms aggregation counts the number of occurrences for every unique value in a field. For example, the following query
groups the `mock_items` table by `rating`, and calculates the number of items for each unique `rating`.

```sql
SELECT rating, COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all()
GROUP BY rating
LIMIT 10;
```

Ordering by the bucketing field is supported:

```sql
SELECT rating, COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all()
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY rating
LIMIT 10;
```

<Note>
  Ordering by `COUNT` is not yet supported -- queries that do so will not be
  optimized.
</Note>

<Note>
  All fields in the `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses, in this case `rating`,
  must be indexed as [fast](/documentation/indexing/fast-fields).
</Note>

For performance reasons, we strongly recommend adding a `LIMIT` to the `GROUP BY`. Terms aggregations without a `LIMIT` consume more memory and
are slower to execute. If a query does not have a limit and more than `65000` unique values are found in a field, an error will be returned.

To verify that a terms aggregation was pushed down, look for a `ParadeDB Aggregate Scan` with `terms` in the `EXPLAIN` output:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT rating, COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ pdb.all()
GROUP BY rating
LIMIT 10;
```
