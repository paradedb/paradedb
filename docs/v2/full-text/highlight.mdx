<Note>
  Highlighting is an expensive process and can slow down query times. We
  recommend passing a `LIMIT` to any query where `pdb.snippet` is called to
  restrict the number of snippets that need to be generated.

<Note>
  Highlighting is not supported for fuzzy search.

Highlighting refers to the practice of visually emphasizing the portions of a document that match a user's
search query.

## Basic Usage

`pdb.snippet(<column>)` can be added to any query where an `@@@` operator is present.
The following query generates highlighted snippets against the `description` field.

```sql
SELECT id, pdb.snippet(description)
FROM mock_items
WHERE description ||| 'shoes'
LIMIT 5;
```

<ParamField body="start_tag" default="<b>">
  The leading indicator around the highlighted region.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="end_tag" default="</b>">
  The trailing indicator around the highlighted region.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="max_num_chars" default={150}>
  Max number of characters for a highlighted fragment.
</ParamField>

By default, `<b></b>` encloses the snippet. This can be configured with `start_tag` and `end_tag`:

```sql
SELECT id, pdb.snippet(description, start_tag => '<i>', end_tag => '</i>')
FROM mock_items
WHERE description ||| 'shoes'
LIMIT 5;
```

## Byte Offsets

`pdb.snippet_positions(<column>)` returns the byte offsets in the original text where the snippets would appear. It returns an array of
tuples, where the the first element of the tuple is the byte index of the first byte of the highlighted region, and the second element is the byte index after the last byte of the region.

```sql
SELECT id, pdb.snippet(description), pdb.snippet_positions(description)
FROM mock_items
WHERE description ||| 'shoes'
LIMIT 5;
```
