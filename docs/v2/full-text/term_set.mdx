title: Term Set

In addition to query strings, [match](/v2/full-text/match) and [term](/v2/full-text/term) operators also accept text arrays,
where each entry in the array is an exact token. To find documents that match **any one token** in the array, pass a text array to the right-hand side of `===`:

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description === ARRAY['shoes', 'running'];
```

<Note>
  The above query is equivalent to using the `|||` match disjunction operator.
  However, `===` is preferred because it uses a more optimized execution path.
</Note>

To find documents that match **all tokens** in an array, use the `&&&` operator:

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description &&& ARRAY['shoes', 'running'];
```

<Note>
  Text arrays passed to the right-hand side of a ParadeDB operator are treated
  as arrays of finalized tokens. No additional processing is done to these
  tokens.
