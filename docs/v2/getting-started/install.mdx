title: Install ParadeDB
---

The fastest way to install ParadeDB is by pulling the ParadeDB Docker image and running it locally. If
your primary Postgres is in a virtual private cloud (VPC), we recommend deploying ParadeDB on a compute
instance within your VPC to avoid exposing public IP addresses and needing to provision traffic routing
rules.

**Note**: ParadeDB supports Postgres 14+, and the `latest` tag ships with Postgres 17. To specify a different Postgres version, please refer to the available tags on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/paradedb/paradedb/tags).

```bash
docker run \
  --name paradedb \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase \
  -v paradedb_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/ \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d \
  paradedb/paradedb:latest
```

You may replace `myuser`, `mypassword`, and `mydatabase` with whatever values you want. These will be your database
connection credentials.

To connect to ParadeDB, install the `psql` client and run

```bash
docker exec -it paradedb psql -U myuser -d mydatabase -W
```

To see all the ways in which you can install ParadeDB, please refer to our [deployment documentation](/deploy).

That's it! Next, let's [run a few queries](/documentation/getting-started/quickstart) over mock data with ParadeDB.
