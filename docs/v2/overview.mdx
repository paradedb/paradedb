## Welcome to `v2`

ParadeDB is undergoing a revamp to make its SQL interface more intuitive and ORM-friendly.
This new experience is being introduced as `v2` of the API.

`v1` will remain fully supported — there’s no need to change existing integrations.
`v2` focuses on improving developer experience across three key areas:

### Declarative Schema Configuration

No more complex JSON strings to configure tokenizers, fast fields, etc.

### Transparent Search Operators

More intuitive syntax and more transparent behavior, making it easier to understand exactly what's happening just by reading the SQL query.

### ORM-Friendly Query Builders

Queries will support structured column references instead of relying on string literals, improving compatibility with query builders and reducing runtime errors.

## Rollout Timeline

The `v2` API will be rolled out iteratively, with new features and improvements added to this section of the documentation as they land.

- Full coverage of the existing `v1` API is targeted by the end of August 2025.
- `v2` will exit beta and become generally available by the end of September 2025.

During this period, users are encouraged to explore the new features and provide feedback as we refine the interface.
