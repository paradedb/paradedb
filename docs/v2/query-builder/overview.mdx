In addition to basic [match](/v2/full-text/match), [phrase](/v2/full-text/phrase), and
[term](/v2/full-text/term) queries, additional advanced query types are exposed as query builder functions.

Query builder functions use the `@@@` operator. `@@@` takes a column on the left-hand side and a query builder function on the
right-hand side. It means "find all rows where the column matches the given query."

For example:

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ pdb.regex('key.*rd');
```

<Accordion title="Expected Output">
```csv
       description        | rating |  category
--------------------------+--------+-------------
 Ergonomic metal keyboard |      4 | Electronics
 Plastic Keyboard         |      4 | Electronics
(2 rows)
```
</Accordion>

This uses the [regex](/v2/query-builder/term/regex) query builder function to match all rows where `description` matches the regex expression `key.*rd`.
