title: Term
---

A term query treats the query as a single token. Because it does not apply any additional tokenization or processing
to the query, it is useful when looking for **exact** matches.

Under the hood, the [term operator](/documentation/v2/full-text/term) gets rewritten to this query builder function.
By default we recommend using the [term operator](/documentation/v2/full-text/term) instead of this function.

## Basic Usage

Matches documents containing a specified [term](/documentation/concepts/term).

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ pdb.term('shoes');
```

Numeric, boolean, or datetime fields can also be passed into the `term` query. Doing so is equivalent to using the
`=` equality operator.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE rating @@@ pdb.term(4);
```

## Enumerated Types

`term` can be used to filter over custom Postgres [enums](/documentation/indexing/create_index#enumerated-types)
if the query term is explicitly cast to the enum type.

In this example, `color` is a custom enum:

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE color @@@ pdb.term('red'::color);
```
