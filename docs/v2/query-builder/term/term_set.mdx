title: Term Set
---

<Note>
  BM25 scoring is not enabled for term set queries. As a result, the scores
  returned may not be accurate. This behavior reflects the underlying
  implementation in Tantivy.
</Note>

Matches documents containing any [term](/documentation/concepts/term) from a specified set.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ pdb.term_set(ARRAY['shoes', 'keyboard']);
```

`pdb.term_set` is equivalent to `OR`ing together multiple `pdb.term` queries.
