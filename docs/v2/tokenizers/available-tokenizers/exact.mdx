The literal tokenizer applies no tokenization to the text, preserving it as-is. It is the default for `uuid` fields (since
exact UUID matching is a common use case), and is useful for doing exact string matching over text fields.

```sql
CREATE INDEX search_idx ON mock_items
USING bm25 (id, (description::pdb.literal))
WITH (key_field='id');
```

To get a feel for this tokenizer, run the following command and replace the text with your own:

```sql
SELECT 'Tokenize me!'::pdb.literal::text[];
```

```ini Expected Response
       text
------------------
 {"Tokenize me!"}
(1 row)
```

<Note>
  Because the literal tokenizer preserves the source text exactly, [token
  filters](/v2/token-filters/overview) cannot be configured for this tokenizer.
