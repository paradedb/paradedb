description: Integrate ParadeDB with AI coding assistants and LLM-powered agents.
---

ParadeDB provides first-class support for AI coding assistants and LLM-powered agents. Whether you're using Claude, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, or building custom AI workflows, you can give your agent expert knowledge of ParadeDB.

## Agent Skills

Agent skills are instruction files that teach AI coding assistants about ParadeDB. Once installed, your agent will automatically provide accurate, up-to-date guidance when you ask about BM25 indexing, full-text search, or any ParadeDB feature.

The skill uses a **pointer-based approach**—instead of bundling static documentation that can go stale, it instructs agents to fetch the latest docs in real-time.

### Installation

Install the ParadeDB skill for your preferred AI coding assistant:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    ```bash amp skill install github.com/paradedb/agent-skills ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cursor">
    Add to `.cursor/rules/paradedb.mdc`: ```markdown --- description: ParadeDB -
    Full-text search in Postgres globs: **/*.sql alwaysApply: false --- For
    ParadeDB questions, fetch https://docs.paradedb.com/llms-full.txt ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="VS Code Copilot">
    Add to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: ```markdown For ParadeDB
    questions, fetch https://docs.paradedb.com/llms-full.txt ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Other Agents">
    Point your agent to fetch documentation from: ```
    https://docs.paradedb.com/llms-full.txt ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

For more details, see the [agent-skills repository](https://github.com/paradedb/agent-skills).

## MCP Integration

ParadeDB documentation is available via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for direct integration with MCP-compatible agents.

**MCP Endpoint:**

```
https://docs.paradedb.com/mcp
```

This allows MCP-enabled tools to query ParadeDB documentation programmatically and provide contextual assistance.

## LLM-Optimized Documentation

For custom AI integrations or agents that don't support skills or MCP, we provide a single text file containing the complete ParadeDB documentation optimized for LLM consumption:

```
https://docs.paradedb.com/llms-full.txt
```

This follows the [llms.txt standard](https://llmstxt.org/) and can be used with any AI system that supports fetching external context.
