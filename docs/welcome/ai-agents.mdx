description: Integrate ParadeDB with AI coding assistants and LLM-powered agents.
---

ParadeDB provides first-class support for AI coding assistants and LLM-powered agents. Whether you're using Claude, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, or building custom AI workflows, you can give your agent expert knowledge of ParadeDB.

## Agent Skills

Agent skills are instruction files that teach AI coding assistants about ParadeDB. Once installed, your agent will automatically provide accurate, up-to-date guidance when you ask about BM25 indexing, full-text search, or any ParadeDB feature.

The skill uses a **pointer-based approach**—instead of bundling static documentation that can go stale, it instructs agents to fetch the latest docs in real-time.

For installation instructions, see the [agent-skills repository](https://github.com/paradedb/agent-skills).

## MCP Integration

ParadeDB documentation is available via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for direct integration with MCP-compatible agents.

**MCP Endpoint:**

```
https://docs.paradedb.com/mcp
```

This allows MCP-enabled tools to query ParadeDB documentation programmatically and provide contextual assistance.
