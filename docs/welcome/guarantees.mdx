title: Guarantees

### ACI(D)

All reads and writes go through Postgres’ transaction engine. This means that inserts, updates, and deletes to indexed columns are atomic, consistent, and respect Postgres' [isolation levels](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html).

Durability — the "D" in ACID — means that once a transaction is committed, its changes will survive crashes or failovers. In PostgreSQL, this guarantee is provided by the write-ahead log (WAL), which ensures that all changes are safely recorded before being applied to disk.

ParadeDB Community, the open-source version of ParadeDB, does **not** write to the WAL, and therefore does not guarantee durability in the face of crashes. For production use cases that require full durability, [ParadeDB Enterprise](/deploy/enterprise) — a closed-source fork of ParadeDB available to paying customers — includes full WAL integration.

### Concurrency

ParadeDB is designed to support concurrent reads and writes in the same way that Postgres does — by following Postgres' [multi-version
concurrency control (MVCC)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.1/mvcc.html) rules. We maintain an internal testing suite that rigorously measures the read and write throughput of the BM25
index under concurrent load.

Both read and write throughput under concurrent load can be improved by tuning Postgres' settings. For instance, read throughput can be improved
by configuring the [`max_parallel_worker` pool](/configuration/parallel#parallel-workers) and [buffer cache size](/configuration/parallel#shared-buffers),
whereas writes can be improved by increasing [per-statement memory](/configuration/write#work-memory).

### Replication safety



### Data Integrity

All data inserted into the BM25 index must conform to the column’s declared type. ParadeDB relies on Postgres’ type system and input/output functions to ensure validity. For example:
Invalid data will result in a Postgres error at insert time, not at query time.
