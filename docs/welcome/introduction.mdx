## Who is ParadeDB for?

You are likely a good fit for ParadeDB if you identify with the following:

1. Your **primary database is Postgres**, either managed (e.g. AWS RDS) or self-managed
2. You **have used Postgres' built-in search** capabilities via `tsvector` and the GIN index, but have reached a scale where you're limited by **performance bottlenecks** or **missing features** like BM25 scoring or fuzzy search
3. You are evaluating a search engine like Elasticsearch, but **don't want to add an additional, cumbersome dependency** to your stack

## Why ParadeDB?

For teams that already use Postgres, ParadeDB is the simplest way to bring Elastic-quality search to your application.

### Zero ETL Required

Syncing Postgres with an external search engine like Elastic can be a time-consuming, error-prone process that involves babysitting ETL pipelines
and debugging data inconsistency issues. ParadeDB eliminates this class of problems because you can:

- [Install](/deploy/self-hosted/extension) the ParadeDB extension directly inside your Postgres, if it is self-managed
- [Run ParadeDB as a logical replica](/deploy/self-hosted/logical-replication/getting-started) of your primary Postgres, if you use managed Postgres providers like RDS

### Search That Feels Like Postgres

In ParadeDB, writing a search query is as simple as writing SQL. ParadeDB supports JOINs, which removes the complexity of denormalizing your existing schema.

### As Reliable As Postgres

ParadeDB supports Postgres transactions and ACID guarantees. This means that data is searchable immediately
after it's written to ParadeDB, and durable thanks to Postgres write-ahead logging.

## ParadeDB vs. Alternatives

People usually compare ParadeDB to two other types of systems: OLTP databases like vanilla Postgres and search engines like Elastic.
