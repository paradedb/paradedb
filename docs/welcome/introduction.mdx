## What is ParadeDB?

ParadeDB is an Elasticsearch alternative built on Postgres. We're modernizing the features of Elasticsearch,
starting with real-time search and analytics.

ParadeDB is not a fork of Postgres, but regular Postgres with custom extensions installed. ParadeDB itself
ships with Postgres 16.

## Why ParadeDB

Today, Postgres users that need a search and analytics engine face two options: adopt an external service like
Elasticsearch, which is powerful but painful to run, tune, and sync, or use Postgres’ native search and
aggregations, which lack critical functionality and perform poorly over large datasets.

ParadeDB aims to be the best of both worlds, providing developers with the familiarity of Postgres and the
performance of a dedicated search and analytical database.

ParadeDB is a good fit for:



- Developers who sync data from Postgres to Elasticsearch and 
- 

- 


- Developers who trust Postgres and don't want to operate a non-Postgres database/query engine
- Elasticsearch users who want to consolidate their data stack on Postgres
- Full-text, similarity, or hybrid search over large volumes of operational data with zero ETL
- Building rich search experiences with analytical queries and facets
