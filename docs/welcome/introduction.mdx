![ParadeDB Banner](/images/paradedb_banner.png)

ParadeDB is an open-source, ACID-compliant full-text search and analytics database, built for speed and reliability under update-heavy workloads.

ParadeDB is built on top of Postgres. It provides battle-tested reliability and consistency for the most demanding workloads, now with state-of-the-art search. 

## Why ParadeDB?

There are many search engines in the world, but they are mostly built for static datasets and eventual consistency. ParadeDB is for users who
want a first-class full-text search experience, but frequently update data and value consistency between their source and their indexes. 

ParadeDB may be a good fit for your stack if:

- **You frequently update** the data you want to run full-text search queries over
- **Elasticsearch lag, shard loss, or stale indexes** keep you up at night
- You spend more time **babysitting ETL processes** than doing things that matter
- It feels counterintuative to **seperate search from source**
- You **enjoy using Postgres**, you **hate using Elasticsearch**, or something in between
- You **value simplicity** when designing systems

## ParadeDB vs. Alternatives

People usually compare ParadeDB to two other types of systems: OLTP databases and search engines.


|                    | **OLTP databases** | **Search engines** | **ParadeDB** |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **Primary role**   | System of record                               | Search and retrieval engine                          | System of record **and** search engine in one |
| **Examples**   | Postgres, MySQL                               | Elasticsearch, OpenSearch |
| **ACID guarantees**| ✅ Full ACID compliance                        | ❌ Limited (atomicity only per-document, weak isolation, not guaranteed durable) | ✅ Full ACID compliance |
| **Search features**| Basic FTS, limited ranking/relevance           | Advanced ranking (BM25), hybrid search           | Advanced ranking (BM25), hybrid search** |
| **Lag**    | None in a single cluster                    | At **least** network plus index creation time                    | None in a single cluster
| **Operational cost**| Simple (single datastore)                     | Complex (ETL pipelines, running two systems)         | Simple (single datastore) |
| **Language**      | SQL   | Custom DSL           | SQL extended for full-text-search



## Production Readiness

As a company, ParadeDB is over two years old. ParadeDB launched in the [Y Combinator (YC)](https://ycombinator.com) S23 batch and has been validated in
production since December 2023.

[ParadeDB Community](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb), the open-source version of ParadeDB, has been deployed over 100,000 times in the past 12 months.
ParadeDB Enterprise, the durable and production-hardened edition
of ParadeDB, powers core search and analytics use cases at enterprises ranging from Fortune 500s to fast-growing startups. A few
examples include:

- **Alibaba**, the largest Asia-Pacific cloud provider, uses ParadeDB to power search inside their data warehouse. [Case study available](https://paradedb.com/blog/case_study_alibaba).
- **Bilt Rewards**<sup>1</sup>, a rent payments technology company that processed over $36B in payments in 2024.
- **Modern Treasury**<sup>1</sup>, a financial technology company that automates the full cycle of money movement.
- **UnifyGTM**<sup>1</sup>, one of the fastest-growing startups in AI sales automation.
- **TCDI**<sup>1</sup>, a giant in the legal software and litigation management space.
