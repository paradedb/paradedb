title: The Transactional Elasticsearch Alternative
---

![ParadeDB Banner](/images/paradedb_banner.png)

ParadeDB is an open source, ACID-compliant alternative to Elasticsearch. ParadeDB is built on Postgres as a Postgres extension, not a fork of Postgres.

## Why ParadeDB?

There are many search engines in the world, but they are mostly built for static datasets and eventual consistency. ParadeDB is for users who
want first-class search and analytics performance, but frequently update data and need consistency between their source and their indexes.

ParadeDB may be a good fit for your stack if:

- **You frequently update** the data you want to run search queries over
- **Elasticsearch lag, shard loss, or stale indexes** keep you up at night
- You spend more time **babysitting ETL processes** than doing things that matter
- You **enjoy using Postgres**, you **hate using Elasticsearch**, or something in between
- **You have tried tsvector and the GIN index for Postgres text search**, but lack of fuzzy matching, BM25 relevance scoring, advanced query types, etc. leads to low-quality results
- Analytical queries in Postgres (e.g. `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, etc.) **hit timeouts**
- You **value simplicity** when designing systems

## ParadeDB vs. Alternatives

People usually compare ParadeDB to two other types of systems: OLTP databases like vanilla Postgres and search engines like Elastic.
