ParadeDB is an open source, ACID-compliant search and analytics database. Built on Postgres for update-heavy workloads.

## Why ParadeDB?

There are many search engines in the world, but they are mostly built for static datasets and eventual consistency. ParadeDB is for users who
want a first-class search experience, but frequently update data and value consistency between their source and their indexes.

ParadeDB may be a good fit for your stack if:

- **You frequently update** the data you want to run search queries over
- **Elasticsearch lag, shard loss, or stale indexes** keep you up at night
- You spend more time **babysitting ETL processes** than doing things that matter
- You **enjoy using Postgres**, you **hate using Elasticsearch**, or something in between
- **You have tried tsvector and the GIN index for Postgres text search**, but lack of fuzzy matching, BM25 relevance scoring, advanced query types, etc. leads to low-quality results.
- You **value simplicity** when designing systems, and would prefer to search directly rather than on a remote index.

## ParadeDB vs. Alternatives

People usually compare ParadeDB to two other types of systems: OLTP databases and search engines.

## Production Readiness

As a company, ParadeDB is over two years old. ParadeDB launched in the [Y Combinator (YC)](https://ycombinator.com) S23 batch and has been validated in
production since December 2023.

[ParadeDB Community](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb), the open-source version of ParadeDB, has been deployed over 100,000 times in the past 12 months.
ParadeDB Enterprise, the durable and production-hardened edition
of ParadeDB, powers core search and analytics use cases at enterprises ranging from Fortune 500s to fast-growing startups. A few
examples include:

- **Alibaba**, the largest Asia-Pacific cloud provider, uses ParadeDB to power search inside their data warehouse. [Case study available](https://paradedb.com/blog/case_study_alibaba).
- **Bilt Rewards**<sup>1</sup>, a rent payments technology company that processed over $36B in payments in 2024.
- **Modern Treasury**<sup>1</sup>, a financial technology company that automates the full cycle of money movement.
- **UnifyGTM**<sup>1</sup>, one of the fastest-growing startups in AI sales automation.
