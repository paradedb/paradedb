We're a lean team that likes to ship at [incredibly high velocity](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases).

## In Progress

### JOIN Improvements

- **Scoring and highlighting across JOINs**. BM25 score and snippet functions can be used in `JOIN` queries.
- **Smarter JOIN planning for search indexes**. Apply index-aware optimizations and cost estimation strategies when multiple BM25-indexed tables are joined.
- **Faster JOIN performance through predicate pushdown**. Search predicates are selectively pushed down to relevant tables based on indexability and selectivity, improving `JOIN` query speed.

### Ecosystem Integrations

- **ORMs**. Official support for popular ORMs, like Django, Prisma, Active Record, and many others is coming.
- **AI Frameworks**. Official support for LangChain, LLamaIndex, CrewAI, and others are coming.
- **PaaS Providers**. Official tutorials for hosting ParadeDB on platform-as-a-service providers like Railway, DigitalOcean, Porter.run, and many others is coming.

## Long Term

### Deeper Analytics Improvements

- **Push Postgres visibility rules into the index**. This is currently a filter applied post index scan that adds overhead to large scans.
- **Evaluate more industry-standard OLAP tools**. A new file format? Query execution library?

### Vector Search Improvements

- Postgres (and by extension, ParadeDB) uses [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) for vector search. Contingent on demand and internal resources, we may
  investigate what improvements can be made to the known limitations of `pgvector`.

### Managed Cloud

- Today, you can [deploy ParadeDB](/deploy/overview) either self-hosted or with ParadeDB BYOC. We are working on a fully managed cloud offering,
  with a focus on scalability and supporting distributed workloads.

## Completed

### Analytics

- **A custom scan node for aggregates**. This will allow "plain SQL" aggregates to go through the same fast execution path as
  our [aggregate UDFs](/documentation/aggregates/tantivy), further accelerating aggregates like `COUNT`, and SQL clauses like `GROUP BY`.

### Write Throughput

- **Background merging**. Improves write performance by merging index segments asynchronously without blocking inserts.
- **Pending list**. Buffers recent write before flushing them to the LSM tree.

### Improved UX

- **More intuitive index configuration**. Overhaul the complicated JSON `WITH` index options.
- **More ORM friendly**. Overhaul the [query builder functions](/documentation/query-builder/overview) to use actual column references instead of string literals.
- **New operators**. In addition to the existing `@@@` operator, introduce new operators for different query types (e.g. phrase, term, conjunction/disjunction).

## We're Hiring

We're tackling some of the hardest and (in our opinion) most impactful problems in Postgres. If you want to be a part of it,
