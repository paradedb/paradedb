//! Internal window function placeholder.
//!
//! This module provides `window_agg()`, which is used internally to replace
//! window aggregate calls (like `COUNT(*) OVER ()` or `paradedb.agg(...) OVER ()`)
//! during query planning.
//!
//! ## How It Works
//!
//! 1. During planning, the planner hook detects window functions in queries with the `@@@` operator
//! 2. These window functions are replaced with calls to `window_agg(json)` where the JSON
//!    contains the serialized aggregation specification
//! 3. The custom scan intercepts these placeholder calls and executes the actual aggregations
//!    using Tantivy collectors
//! 4. This function should never actually execute - if it does, it indicates a bug
//!
//! ## User-Facing API
//!
//! Users should never call `window_agg()` directly. Instead, they should use:
//! - Standard SQL window functions: `COUNT(*) OVER ()`, `SUM(field) OVER ()`, etc.
//! - Custom aggregations: `paradedb.agg('{"avg": {"field": "price"}}'::jsonb) OVER ()`
//!
//! Both of these get automatically converted to `window_agg()` calls during planning.
