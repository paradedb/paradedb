//! High-level glue between PostgreSQL parallel-query callbacks and the
//! coordinator/worker MPP architecture.
//!
//! Customscan code calls into this module from four hooks; everything else
//! (DSM math, shm_mq FFI, DF-D fork's `WorkerTransport` plumbing) is hidden
//! behind the API:
//!
//! - [`mpp_is_active`] — gate for the customscan path-builder.
//! - [`estimate_dsm_size`] — `estimate_dsm_custom_scan` body.
//! - [`leader_setup`] — `initialize_dsm_custom_scan` body. Returns the
//!   leader's [`MppLeaderState`] which carries the runtime [`MppMesh`]
//!   handle the customscan installs on its DataFusion `SessionContext`.
//! - [`worker_setup`] — `initialize_worker_custom_scan` body. Returns the
//!   worker's [`MppWorkerState`] which carries the worker's outbound
//!   senders and the deserialized plan bytes the worker runs.
